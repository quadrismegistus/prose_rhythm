    The keen stars were twinkling,
And the fair moon was rising among them,
        Dear Jane!
    The guitar was tinkling,
But the notes were not sweet till you sung them
        Again.
    As the moon's soft splendour
O'er the faint cold starlight of Heaven
        Is thrown,
    So your voice most tender
To the strings without soul had then given
        Its own.
    The stars will awaken,
Though the moon sleep a full hour later,
        To-night;
    No leaf will be shaken
Whilst the dews of your melody scatter
        Delight.
    Though the sound overpowers,
Sing again, with your dear voice revealing
        A tone
    Of some world far from ours,
Where music and moonlight and feeling
        Are one.



We meet not as we parted,
    We feel more than all may see;
My bosom is heavy-hearted,
    And thine full of doubt for me:—
    One moment has bound the free.
That moment is gone for ever,
    Like lightning that flashed and died—
Like a snowflake upon the river—
    Like a sunbeam upon the tide,
    Which the dark shadows hide.
That moment from time was singled
    As the first of a life of pain;
The cup of its joy was mingled
    —Delusion too sweet though vain!
    Too sweet to be mine again.
Sweet lips, could my heart have hidden
    That its life was crushed by you,
Ye would not have then forbidden
    The death which a heart so true
    Sought in your briny dew.
[....]
[....]
[....]
Methinks too little cost
For a moment so found, so lost!



Let those who pine in pride or in revenge,
    Or think that ill for ill should be repaid,
Who barter wrong for wrong, until the exchange
    Ruins the merchants of such thriftless trade,
Visit the tower of Vado, and unlearn
Such bitter faith beside Marenghi's urn.
A massy tower yet overhangs the town,
    A scattered group of ruined dwellings now [....][....]
Another scene ere wise Etruria knew
    Its second ruin through internal strife,
And tyrants through the breach of discord threw
    The chain which binds and kills. As death to life,
As winter to fair flowers (though some be poison)
So Monarchy succeeds to Freedom's foison.
In Pisa's church a cup of sculptured gold
    Was brimming with the blood of feuds forsworn:
A Sacrament more holy ne'er of old
    Etrurians mingled mid the shades forlorn
Of moon-illumined forests, when [....]
And reconciling factions wet their lips
    With that dread wine, and swear to keep each spirit
Undarkened by their country's last eclipse [....][....]
Was Florence the liberticide? that band
    Of free and glorious brothers who had planted,
Like a green isle mid Aethiopian sand,
    A nation amid slaveries, disenchanted
Of many impious faiths—wise, just—do they,
    Does Florence, gorge the sated tyrants' prey?
O foster-nurse of man's abandoned glory,
    Since Athens, its great mother, sunk in splendour;
Thou shadowest forth that mighty shape in story,
    As ocean its wrecked fanes, severe yet tender:—
The light-invested angel Poesy
Was drawn from the dim world to welcome thee.
And thou in painting didst transcribe all taught
    By loftiest meditations; marble knew
The sculptor's fearless soul—and as he wrought,
    The grace of his own power and freedom grew.
And more than all, heroic, just, sublime,
Thou wert among the false . . . was this thy crime?
Yes; and on Pisa's marble walls the twine
    Of direst weeds hangs garlanded—the snake
Inhabits its wrecked palaces;—in thine
    A beast of subtler venom now doth make
Its lair, and sits amid their glories overthrown,
And thus thy victim's fate is as thine own.
The sweetest flowers are ever frail and rare,
    And love and freedom blossom but to wither;
And good and ill like vines entangled are,
    So that their grapes may oft be plucked together;—
Divide the vintage ere thou drink, then make
Thy heart rejoice for dead Marenghi's sake.
[Albert] Marenghi was a Florentine;
    If he had wealth, or children, or a wife
Or friends, [or farm] or cherished thoughts which twine
    The sights and sounds of home with life's own life
Of these he was despoiled and Florence sent [....][....]
No record of his crime remains in story,
    But if the morning bright as evening shone,
It was some high and holy deed, by glory
    Pursued into forgetfulness, which won
From the blind crowd he made secure and free
The patriot's meed, toil, death, and infamy.
For when by sound of trumpet was declared
    A price upon his life, and there was set
A penalty of blood on all who shared
    So much of water with him as might wet
His lips, which speech divided not—he went
Alone, as you may guess, to banishment.
Amid the mountains, like a hunted beast,
    He hid himself, and hunger, toil, and cold,
Month after month endured; it was a feast
    Whene'er he found those globes of deep-red gold
Which in the woods the strawberry-tree doth bear,
Suspended in their emerald atmosphere.
And in the roofless huts of vast morasses,
    Deserted by the fever-stricken serf,
All overgrown with reeds and long rank grasses,
    And hillocks heaped of moss-inwoven turf,
And where the huge and speckled aloe made,
Rooted in stones, a broad and pointed shade,—
He housed himself. There is a point of strand
    Near Vado's tower and town; and on one side
The treacherous marsh divides it from the land,
    Shadowed by pine and ilex forests wide,
And on the other, creeps eternally,
Through muddy weeds, the shallow sullen sea.
Here the earth's breath is pestilence, and few
    But things whose nature is at war with life—
Snakes and ill worms—endure its mortal dew.
    The trophies of the clime's victorious strife—
And ringed horns which the buffalo did wear,
And the wolf's dark gray scalp who tracked him there.
And at the utmost point [....] stood there
    The relics of a reed-inwoven cot,
Thatched with broad flags. An outlawed murderer
    Had lived seven days there: the pursuit was hot
When he was cold. The birds that were his grave
Fell dead after their feast in Vado's wave.
There must have burned within Marenghi's breast
    That fire, more warm and bright than life and hope,
(Which to the martyr makes his dungeon [....]
    More joyous than free heaven's majestic cope
To his oppressor), warring with decay,—
Or he could ne'er have lived years, day by day.
Nor was his state so lone as you might think.
    He had tamed every newt and snake and toad,
And every seagull which sailed down to drink
    Those freshes ere the death-mist went abroad.
And each one, with peculiar talk and play,
Wiled, not untaught, his silent time away.
And the marsh-meteors, like tame beasts, at night
    Came licking with blue tongues his veinèd feet;
And he would watch them, as, like spirits bright,
    In many entangled figures quaint and sweet
To some enchanted music they would dance—
Until they vanished at the first moon-glance.
He mocked the stars by grouping on each weed
    The summer dew-globes in the golden dawn;
And, ere the hoar-frost languished, he could read
    Its pictured path, as on bare spots of lawn
Its delicate brief touch in silver weaves
The likeness of the wood's remembered leaves.
And many a fresh Spring morn would he awaken—
    While yet the unrisen sun made glow, like iron
Quivering in crimson fire, the peaks unshaken
    Of mountains and blue isles which did environ
With air-clad crags that plain of land and sea,—
And feel [....] liberty.
And in the moonless nights, when the dun ocean
    Heaved underneath wide heaven, star-impearled,
Starting from dreams [....]
    Communed with the immeasurable world;
And felt his life beyond his limbs dilated,
Till his mind grew like that it contemplated.
His food was the wild fig and strawberry;
    The milky pine-nuts which the autumn-blast
Shakes into the tall grass; or such small fry
    As from the sea by winter-storms are cast;
And the coarse bulbs of iris-flowers he found
Knotted in clumps under the spongy ground.
And so were kindled powers and thoughts which made
    His solitude less dark. When memory came
(For years gone by leave each a deepening shade),
    His spirit basked in its internal flame,—
As, when the black storm hurries round at night,
The fisher basks beside his red firelight.
Yet human hopes and cares and faiths and errors,
    Like billows unawakened by the wind,
Slept in Marenghi still; but that all terrors,
    Weakness, and doubt, had withered in his mind.
His couch [....][....]
And, when he saw beneath the sunset's planet
    A black ship walk over the crimson ocean,—
Its pennon streaming on the blasts that fan it,
    Its sails and ropes all tense and without motion,
Like the dark ghost of the unburied even
Striding athwart the orange-coloured heaven,—
The thought of his own kind who made the soul
    Which sped that wingèd shape through night and day,—
The thought of his own country [....][....]



The odour from the flower is gone
    Which like thy kisses breathed on me;
The colour from the flower is flown
    Which glowed of thee and only thee!
A shrivelled, lifeless, vacant form,
    It lies on my abandoned breast,
And mocks the heart which yet is warm,
    With cold and silent rest.
I weep,—my tears revive it not!
    I sigh,—it breathes no more on me;
Its mute and uncomplaining lot
    Is such as mine should be.



'Twas dead of the night, when I sat in my dwelling;
    One glimmering lamp was expiring and low;
Around the dark tide of the tempest was swelling,
Along the wild mountains night-ravens were yelling,—
    They bodingly presaged destruction and woe.
'Twas then that I started!—the wild storm was howling,
    Nought was seen, save the lightning, which danced in the sky;
Above me, the crash of the thunder was rolling,
    And low, chilling murmurs, the blast wafted by.
My heart sank within me—unheeded the war
    Of the battling clouds, on the mountain-tops, broke;—
Unheeded the thunder-peal crashed in mine ear—
This heart, hard as iron, is stranger to fear;
    But conscience in low, noiseless whispering spoke.
'Twas then that her form on the whirlwind upholding,
    The ghost of the murdered Victoria strode;
In her right hand, a shadowy shroud she was holding,
    She swiftly advanced to my lonesome abode.
I wildly then called on the tempest to bear me—[....]



These are two friends whose lives were undivided;
So let their memory be, now they have glided
Under the grave; let not their bones be parted,
For their two hearts in life were single-hearted.



I rode one evening with Count Maddalo
Upon the bank of land which breaks the flow
Of Adria towards Venice: a bare strand
Of hillocks, heaped from ever-shifting sand,
Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,
Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,
Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,
Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,
Abandons; and no other object breaks
The waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakes
Broken and unrepaired, and the tide makes
A narrow space of level sand thereon,
Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.
This ride was my delight. I love all waste
And solitary places; where we taste
The pleasure of believing what we see
Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be:
And such was this wide ocean, and this shore
More barren than its billows; and yet more
Than all, with a remembered friend I love
To ride as then I rode;—for the winds drove
The living spray along the sunny air
Into our faces; the blue heavens were bare,
Stripped to their depths by the awakening north;
And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forth
Harmonising with solitude, and sent
Into our hearts aëreal merriment.
So, as we rode, we talked; and the swift thought.
Winging itself with laughter, lingered not,
But flew from brain to brain,—such glee was ours.
Charged with light memories of remembered hours.
None slow enough for sadness: till we came
Homeward, which always makes the spirit tame.
This day had been cheerful but cold, and now
The sun was sinking, and the wind also.
Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may be
Talk interrupted with such raillery
As mocks itself, because it cannot scorn
The thoughts it would extinguish:—'twas forlorn,
Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,
The devils held within the dales of Hell
Concerning God, freewill and destiny:
Of all that earth has been or yet may be,
All that vain men imagine or believe,
Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,
We descanted, and I (for ever still
Is it not wise to make the best of ill?)
Argued against despondency, but pride
Made my companion take the darker side.
The sense that he was greater than his kind
Had struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blind
By gazing on its own exceeding light.
Meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight,
Over the horizon of the mountains;—Oh,
How beautiful is sunset, when the glow
Of Heaven descends upon a land like thee,
Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!
Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towers
Of cities they encircle!—it was ours
To stand on thee, beholding it: and then,
Just where we had dismounted, the Count's men
Were waiting for us with the gondola.—
As those who pause on some delightful way
Though bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stood
Looking upon the evening, and the flood
Which lay between the city and the shore.
Paved with the image of the sky . . . the hoar
And aëry Alps towards the North appeared
Through mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark reared
Between the East and West; and half the sky
Was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry
Dark purple at the zenith, which still grew
Down the steep West into a wondrous hue
Brighter than burning gold, even to the rent
Where the swift sun yet paused in his descent
Among the many-folded hills: they were
These famous Euganean hills, which bear,
As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,
The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles—
And then—as if the Earth and Sea had been
Dissolved into one lake of fire, were seen
Those mountains towering as from waves of flame
Around the vaporous sun, from which there came
The inmost purple spirit of light, and made
Their very peaks transparent. ‘Ere it fade,’
Said my companion, ‘I will show you soon
A better station’—so, o'er the lagune
We glided; and from that funereal bark
I leaned, and saw the city, and could mark
How from their many isles, in evening's gleam,
Its temples and its palaces did seem
Like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven.
I was about to speak, when—‘We are even
Now at the point I meant,’ said Maddalo,
And bade the gondolieri cease to row.
‘Look, Julian, on the west, and listen well
If you hear not a deep and heavy bell.’
I looked, and saw between us and the sun
A building on an island; such a one
As age to age might add, for uses vile,
A windowless, deformed and dreary pile;
And on the top an open tower, where hung
A bell, which in the radiance swayed and swung;
We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:
The broad sun sunk behind it, and it tolled
In strong and black relief.—‘What we behold
Shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,’
Said Maddalo, ‘and ever at this hour
Those who may cross the water, hear that bell
Which calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,
To vespers.’—‘As much skill as need to pray
In thanks or hope for their dark lot have they
To their stern maker,’ I replied. ‘O ho!
You talk as in years past,’ said Maddalo.
‘'Tis strange men change not. You were ever still
Among Christ's flock a perilous infidel,
A wolf for the meek lambs—if you can't swim
Beware of Providence.’ I looked on him,
But the gay smile had faded in his eye.
‘And such,’—he cried, ‘is our mortality.
And this must be the emblem and the sign
Of what should be eternal and divine!—
And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,
Hung in a heaven-illumined tower, must toll
Our thoughts and our desires to meet below
Round the rent heart and pray—as madmen do
For what? they know not,—till the night of death
As sunset that strange vision, severeth
Our memory from itself, and us from all
We sought and yet were baffled.’ I recall
The sense of what he said, although I mar
The force of his expressions. The broad star
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,
And the black bell became invisible,
And the red tower looked gray, and all between
The churches, ships and palaces were seen
Huddled in gloom;—into the purple sea
The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.
We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola
Conveyed me to my lodging by the way.
The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:
Ere Maddalo arose, I called on him,
And whilst I waited with his child I played;
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,
A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,
Graceful without design and unforeseeing,
With eyes—Oh speak not of her eyes!—which seem
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam
With such deep meaning, as we never see
But in the human countenance: with me
She was a special favourite: I had nursed
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
To this bleak world; and she yet seemed to know
On second sight her ancient playfellow,
Less changed than she was by six months or so;
For after her first shyness was worn out
We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,
When the Count entered. Salutations past—
‘The word you spoke last night might well have cast
A darkness on my spirit—if man be
The passive thing you say, I should not see
Much harm in the religions and old saws
(Tho' I may never own such leaden laws)
Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:
Mine is another faith’—thus much I spoke
And noting he replied not, added: ‘See
This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;
She spends a happy time with little care,
While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
As came on you last night—it is our will
That thus enchains us to permitted ill—
We might be otherwise—we might be all
We dream of happy, high, majestical.
Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek
But in our mind? and if we were not weak
Should we be less in deed than in desire?’
‘Ay, if we were not weak—and we aspire
How vainly to be strong!’ said Maddalo:
‘You talk Utopia.’ ‘It remains to know,’
I then rejoined, ‘and those who try may find
How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;
Brittle perchance as straw . . . We are assured
Much may be conquered, much may be endured,
Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
That we have power over ourselves to do
And suffer—what, we know not till we try;
But something nobler than to live and die—
So taught those kings of old philosophy
Who reigned, before Religion made men blind;
And those who suffer with their suffering kind
Yet feel their faith, religion.’ ‘My dear friend,’
Said Maddalo, ‘my judgement will not bend
To your opinion, though I think you might
Make such a system refutation-tight
As far as words go. I knew one like you
Who to this city came some months ago,
With whom I argued in this sort, and he
Is now gone mad,—and so he answered me,—
Poor fellow! but if you would like to go
We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show
How vain are such aspiring theories.’
‘I hope to prove the induction otherwise,
And that a want of that true theory, still,
Which seeks a “soul of goodness” in things ill
Or in himself or others, has thus bowed
His being—there are some by nature proud,
Who patient in all else demand but this—
To love and be beloved with gentleness;
And being scorned, what wonder if they die
Some living death? this is not destiny
But man's own wilful ill.’
As thus I spoke
Servants announced the gondola, and we
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands.
We disembarked. The clap of tortured hands,
Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen,
And laughter where complaint had merrier been,
Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers
Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs
Into an old courtyard. I heard on high,
Then, fragments of most touching melody,
But looking up saw not the singer there—
Through the black bars in the tempestuous air
I saw, like weeds on a wrecked palace growing,
Long tangled locks flung wildly forth, and flowing,
Of those who on a sudden were beguiled
Into strange silence, and looked forth and smiled
Hearing sweet sounds.—Then I: ‘Methinks there were
A cure of these with patience and kind care,
If music can thus move . . . but what is he
Whom we seek here?’ ‘Of his sad history
I know but this,’ said Maddalo: ‘he came
To Venice a dejected man, and fame
Said he was wealthy, or he had been so;
Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe;
But he was ever talking in such sort
As you do—far more sadly—he seemed hurt,
Even as a man with his peculiar wrong,
To hear but of the oppression of the strong,
Or those absurd deceits (I think with you
In some respects, you know) which carry through
The excellent impostors of this earth
When they outface detection—he had worth,
Poor fellow! but a humourist in his way’—
‘Alas, what drove him mad?’ ‘I cannot say:
A lady came with him from France, and when
She left him and returned, he wandered then
About yon lonely isles of desert sand
Till he grew wild—he had no cash or land
Remaining,—the police had brought him here—
Some fancy took him and he would not bear
Removal; so I fitted up for him
Those rooms beside the sea, to please his whim,
And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers,
Which had adorned his life in happier hours,
And instruments of music—you may guess
A stranger could do little more or less
For one so gentle and unfortunate:
And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight
From madmen's chains, and make this Hell appear
A heaven of sacred silence, hushed to hear.’—
‘Nay, this was kind of you—he had no claim,
As the world says’—‘None—but the very same
Which I on all mankind were I as he
Fallen to such deep reverse;—his melody
Is interrupted—now we hear the din
Of madmen, shriek on shriek, again begin;
Let us now visit him; after this strain
He ever communes with himself again,
And sees nor hears not any.’ Having said
These words we called the keeper, and he led
To an apartment opening on the sea—
There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully
Near a piano, his pale fingers twined
One with the other, and the ooze and wind
Rushed through an open casement, and did sway
His hair, and starred it with the brackish spray;
His head was leaning on a music book,
And he was muttering, and his lean limbs shook;
His lips were pressed against a folded leaf
In hue too beautiful for health, and grief
Smiled in their motions as they lay apart—
As one who wrought from his own fervid heart
The eloquence of passion, soon he raised
His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed
And spoke—sometimes as one who wrote, and thought
His words might move some heart that heeded not,
If sent to distant lands: and then as one
Reproaching deeds never to be undone
With wondering self-compassion; then his speech
Was lost in grief, and then his words came each
Unmodulated, cold, expressionless,—
But that from one jarred accent you might guess
It was despair made them so uniform:
And all the while the loud and gusty storm
Hissed through the window, and we stood behind
Stealing his accents from the envious wind
Unseen. I yet remember what he said
Distinctly: such impression his words made.
‘Month after month,’ he cried, ‘to bear this load
And as a jade urged by the whip and goad
To drag life on, which like a heavy chain
Lengthens behind with many a link of pain!—
And not to speak my grief—O, not to dare
To give a human voice to my despair,
But live and move, and, wretched thing! smile on
As if I never went aside to groan,
And wear this mask of falsehood even to those
Who are most dear—not for my own repose—
Alas! no scorn or pain or hate could be
So heavy as that falsehood is to me—
But that I cannot bear more altered faces
Than needs must be, more changed and cold embraces,
More misery, disappointment, and mistrust
To own me for their father . . . Would the dust
Were covered in upon my body now!
That the life ceased to toil within my brow!
And then these thoughts would at the least be fled;
Let us not fear such pain can vex the dead.

And this must be the emblem and the sign
Of what should be eternal and divine!—
And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,
Hung in a heaven-illumined tower, must toll
Our thoughts and our desires to meet below
Round the rent heart and pray—as madmen do
For what? they know not,—till the night of death
As sunset that strange vision, severeth
Our memory from itself, and us from all
We sought and yet were baffled.’ I recall
The sense of what he said, although I mar
The force of his expressions. The broad star
Of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,
And the black bell became invisible,
And the red tower looked gray, and all between
The churches, ships and palaces were seen
Huddled in gloom;—into the purple sea
The orange hues of heaven sunk silently.
We hardly spoke, and soon the gondola
Conveyed me to my lodging by the way.
The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:
Ere Maddalo arose, I called on him,
And whilst I waited with his child I played;
A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,
A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,
Graceful without design and unforeseeing,
With eyes—Oh speak not of her eyes!—which seem
Twin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleam
With such deep meaning, as we never see
But in the human countenance: with me
She was a special favourite: I had nursed
Her fine and feeble limbs when she came first
To this bleak world; and she yet seemed to know
On second sight her ancient playfellow,
Less changed than she was by six months or so;
For after her first shyness was worn out
We sate there, rolling billiard balls about,
When the Count entered. Salutations past—
‘The word you spoke last night might well have cast
A darkness on my spirit—if man be
The passive thing you say, I should not see
Much harm in the religions and old saws
(Tho' I may never own such leaden laws)
Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:
Mine is another faith’—thus much I spoke
And noting he replied not, added: ‘See
This lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;
She spends a happy time with little care,
While we to such sick thoughts subjected are
As came on you last night—it is our will
That thus enchains us to permitted ill—
We might be otherwise—we might be all
We dream of happy, high, majestical.
Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seek
But in our mind? and if we were not weak
Should we be less in deed than in desire?’
‘Ay, if we were not weak—and we aspire
How vainly to be strong!’ said Maddalo:
‘You talk Utopia.’ ‘It remains to know,’
I then rejoined, ‘and those who try may find
How strong the chains are which our spirit bind;
Brittle perchance as straw . . . We are assured
Much may be conquered, much may be endured,
Of what degrades and crushes us. We know
That we have power over ourselves to do
And suffer—what, we know not till we try;
But something nobler than to live and die—
So taught those kings of old philosophy
Who reigned, before Religion made men blind;
And those who suffer with their suffering kind
Yet feel their faith, religion.’ ‘My dear friend,’
Said Maddalo, ‘my judgement will not bend
To your opinion, though I think you might
Make such a system refutation-tight
As far as words go. I knew one like you
Who to this city came some months ago,
With whom I argued in this sort, and he
Is now gone mad,—and so he answered me,—
Poor fellow! but if you would like to go
We'll visit him, and his wild talk will show
How vain are such aspiring theories.’
‘I hope to prove the induction otherwise,
And that a want of that true theory, still,
Which seeks a “soul of goodness” in things ill
Or in himself or others, has thus bowed
His being—there are some by nature proud,
Who patient in all else demand but this—
To love and be beloved with gentleness;
And being scorned, what wonder if they die
Some living death? this is not destiny
But man's own wilful ill.’
As thus I spoke
Servants announced the gondola, and we
Through the fast-falling rain and high-wrought sea
Sailed to the island where the madhouse stands.
We disembarked. The clap of tortured hands,
Fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen,
And laughter where complaint had merrier been,
Moans, shrieks, and curses, and blaspheming prayers
Accosted us. We climbed the oozy stairs
Into an old courtyard. I heard on high,
Then, fragments of most touching melody,
But looking up saw not the singer there—
Through the black bars in the tempestuous air
I saw, like weeds on a wrecked palace growing,
Long tangled locks flung wildly forth, and flowing,
Of those who on a sudden were beguiled
Into strange silence, and looked forth and smiled
Hearing sweet sounds.—Then I: ‘Methinks there were
A cure of these with patience and kind care,
If music can thus move . . . but what is he
Whom we seek here?’ ‘Of his sad history
I know but this,’ said Maddalo: ‘he came
To Venice a dejected man, and fame
Said he was wealthy, or he had been so;
Some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe;
But he was ever talking in such sort
As you do—far more sadly—he seemed hurt,
Even as a man with his peculiar wrong,
To hear but of the oppression of the strong,
Or those absurd deceits (I think with you
In some respects, you know) which carry through
The excellent impostors of this earth
When they outface detection—he had worth,
Poor fellow! but a humourist in his way’—
‘Alas, what drove him mad?’ ‘I cannot say:
A lady came with him from France, and when
She left him and returned, he wandered then
About yon lonely isles of desert sand
Till he grew wild—he had no cash or land
Remaining,—the police had brought him here—
Some fancy took him and he would not bear
Removal; so I fitted up for him
Those rooms beside the sea, to please his whim,
And sent him busts and books and urns for flowers,
Which had adorned his life in happier hours,
And instruments of music—you may guess
A stranger could do little more or less
For one so gentle and unfortunate:
And those are his sweet strains which charm the weight
From madmen's chains, and make this Hell appear
A heaven of sacred silence, hushed to hear.’—
‘Nay, this was kind of you—he had no claim,
As the world says’—‘None—but the very same
Which I on all mankind were I as he
Fallen to such deep reverse;—his melody
Is interrupted—now we hear the din
Of madmen, shriek on shriek, again begin;
Let us now visit him; after this strain
He ever communes with himself again,
And sees nor hears not any.’ Having said
These words we called the keeper, and he led
To an apartment opening on the sea—
There the poor wretch was sitting mournfully
Near a piano, his pale fingers twined
One with the other, and the ooze and wind
Rushed through an open casement, and did sway
His hair, and starred it with the brackish spray;
His head was leaning on a music book,
And he was muttering, and his lean limbs shook;
His lips were pressed against a folded leaf
In hue too beautiful for health, and grief
Smiled in their motions as they lay apart—
As one who wrought from his own fervid heart
The eloquence of passion, soon he raised
His sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed
And spoke—sometimes as one who wrote, and thought
His words might move some heart that heeded not,
If sent to distant lands: and then as one
Reproaching deeds never to be undone
With wondering self-compassion; then his speech
Was lost in grief, and then his words came each
Unmodulated, cold, expressionless,—
But that from one jarred accent you might guess
It was despair made them so uniform:
And all the while the loud and gusty storm
Hissed through the window, and we stood behind
Stealing his accents from the envious wind
Unseen. I yet remember what he said
Distinctly: such impression his words made.
‘Month after month,’ he cried, ‘to bear this load
And as a jade urged by the whip and goad
To drag life on, which like a heavy chain
Lengthens behind with many a link of pain!—
And not to speak my grief—O, not to dare
To give a human voice to my despair,
But live and move, and, wretched thing! smile on
As if I never went aside to groan,
And wear this mask of falsehood even to those
Who are most dear—not for my own repose—
Alas! no scorn or pain or hate could be
So heavy as that falsehood is to me—
But that I cannot bear more altered faces
Than needs must be, more changed and cold embraces,
More misery, disappointment, and mistrust
To own me for their father . . . Would the dust
Were covered in upon my body now!
That the life ceased to toil within my brow!
And then these thoughts would at the least be fled;
Let us not fear such pain can vex the dead.
‘What Power delights to torture us? I know
That to myself I do not wholly owe
What now I suffer, though in part I may.
Alas! none strewed sweet flowers upon the way
Where wandering heedlessly, I met pale Pain
My shadow, which will leave me not again—
If I have erred, there was no joy in error,
But pain and insult and unrest and terror;
I have not as some do, bought penitence
With pleasure, and a dark yet sweet offence,
For then,—if love and tenderness and truth
Had overlived hope's momentary youth,
My creed should have redeemed me from repenting;
But loathèd scorn and outrage unrelenting
Met love excited by far other seeming
Until the end was gained . . . as one from dreaming
Of sweetest peace, I woke, and found my state
Such as it is.—
‘O Thou, my spirit's mate
Who, for thou art compassionate and wise,
Wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes
If this sad writing thou shouldst ever see—
My secret groans must be unheard by thee,
Thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know
Thy lost friend's incommunicable woe.
‘Ye few by whom my nature has been weighed
In friendship, let me not that name degrade
By placing on your hearts the secret load
Which crushes mine to dust. There is one road
To peace and that is truth, which follow ye!
Love sometimes leads astray to misery.
Yet think not though subdued—and I may well
Say that I am subdued—that the full Hell
Within me would infect the untainted breast
Of sacred nature with its own unrest;
As some perverted beings think to find
In scorn or hate a medicine for the mind
Which scorn or hate have wounded—O how vain!
The dagger heals not but may rend again . . .
Believe that I am ever still the same
In creed as in resolve, and what may tame
My heart, must leave the understanding free,
Or all would sink in this keen agony—
Nor dream that I will join the vulgar cry;
Or with my silence sanction tyranny;
Or seek a moment's shelter from my pain
In any madness which the world calls gain,
Ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern
As those which make me what I am; or turn
To avarice or misanthropy or lust . . .
Heap on me soon, O grave, thy welcome dust!
Till then the dungeon may demand its prey,
And Poverty and Shame may meet and say—
Halting beside me on the public way—
“That love-devoted youth is ours—let's sit
Beside him—he may live some six months yet.”
Or the red scaffold, as our country bends,
May ask some willing victim, or ye friends
May fall under some sorrow which this heart
Or hand may share or vanquish or avert;
I am prepared—in truth with no proud joy—
To do or suffer aught, as when a boy
I did devote to justice and to love
My nature, worthless now! . . .
‘I must remove
A veil from my pent mind. 'Tis torn aside!
O, pallid as Death's dedicated bride,
Thou mockery which art sitting by my side,
Am I not wan like thee? at the grave's call
I haste, invited to thy wedding-ball
To greet the ghastly paramour, for whom
Thou hast deserted me . . . and made the tomb
Thy bridal bed . . . But I beside your feet
Will lie and watch ye from my winding sheet—
Thus . . . wide awake tho' dead . . . yet stay, O stay!
Go not so soon—I know not what I say—
Hear but my reasons . . I am mad, I fear,
My fancy is o'erwrought . . thou art not here. . .
Pale art thou, 'tis most true . . but thou art gone,
Thy work is finished . . . I am left alone!—

‘Nay, was it I who wooed thee to this breast
Which, like a serpent, thou envenomest
As in repayment of the warmth it lent?
Didst thou not seek me for thine own content?
Did not thy love awaken mine? I thought
That thou wert she who said, “You kiss me not
Ever, I fear you do not love me now”—
In truth I loved even to my overthrow
Her, who would fain forget these words: but they
Cling to her mind, and cannot pass away.
‘You say that I am proud—that when I speak
My lip is tortured with the wrongs which break
The spirit it expresses . . . Never one
Humbled himself before, as I have done!
Even the instinctive worm on which we tread
Turns, though it wound not—then with prostrate head
Sinks in the dusk and writhes like me—and dies?
No: wears a living death of agonies!
As the slow shadows of the pointed grass
Mark the eternal periods, his pangs pass
Slow, ever-moving,—making moments be
As mine seem—each an immortality!
‘That you had never seen me—never heard
My voice, and more than all had ne'er endured
The deep pollution of my loathed embrace—
That your eyes ne'er had lied love in my face—
That, like some maniac monk, I had torn out
The nerves of manhood by their bleeding root
With mine own quivering fingers, so that ne'er
Our hearts had for a moment mingled there
To disunite in horror—these were not
With thee, like some suppressed and hideous thought
Which flits athwart our musings, but can find
No rest within a pure and gentle mind . . .
Thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word,
And searedst my memory o'er them,—for I heard
And can forget not . . . they were ministered
One after one, those curses. Mix them up
Like self-destroying poisons in one cup,
And they will make one blessing which thou ne'er
Didst imprecate for, on me,—death.
‘It were
A cruel punishment for one most cruel,
If such can love, to make that love the fuel
Of the mind's hell; hate, scorn, remorse, despair:
But me—whose heart a stranger's tear might wear
As water-drops the sandy fountain-stone,
Who loved and pitied all things, and could moan
For woes which others hear not, and could see
The absent with the glance of phantasy,
And with the poor and trampled sit and weep,
Following the captive to his dungeon deep;
Me—who am as a nerve o'er which do creep
The else unfelt oppressions of this earth,
And was to thee the flame upon thy hearth,
When all beside was cold—that thou on me
Shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony—
Such curses are from lips once eloquent
With love's too partial praise—let none relent
Who intend deeds too dreadful for a name
Henceforth, if an example for the same
They seek . . . for thou on me lookedst so, and so—
And didst speak thus . . and thus . . . I live to show
How much men bear and die not!
‘Thou wilt tell,
With the grimace of hate, how horrible
It was to meet my love when thine grew less;
Thou wilt admire how I could e'er address
Such features to love's work . . . this taunt, though true,
(For indeed Nature nor in form nor hue
Bestowed on me her choicest workmanship)
Shall not be thy defence . . . for since thy lip
Met mine first, years long past, since thine eye kindled
With soft fire under mine, I have not dwindled
Nor changed in mind or body, or in aught
But as love changes what it loveth not
After long years and many trials.
‘How vain
Are words! I thought never to speak again,
Not even in secret,—not to my own heart—
But from my lips the unwilling accents start,
And from my pen the words flow as I write,
Dazzling my eyes with scalding tears . . . my sight
Is dim to see that charactered in vain
On this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain
And eats into it . . . blotting all things fair
And wise and good which time had written there.
‘Those who inflict must suffer, for they see
The work of their own hearts, and this must be
Our chastisement or recompense—O child!
I would that thine were like to be more mild
For both our wretched sakes . . . for thine the most
Who feelest already all that thou hast lost
Without the power to wish it thine again;
And as slow years pass, a funereal train
Each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend
Following it like its shadow, wilt thou bend
No thought on my dead memory?

‘Alas, love!
Fear me not . . . against thee I would not move
A finger in despite. Do I not live
That thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve?
I give thee tears for scorn and love for hate;
And that thy lot may be less desolate
Than his on whom thou tramplest, I refrain
From that sweet sleep which medicines all pain.
Then, when thou speakest of me, never say
“He could forgive not.” Here I cast away
All human passions, all revenge, all pride;
I think, speak, act no ill; I do but hide
Under these words, like embers, every spark
Of that which has consumed me—quick and dark
The grave is yawning . . . as its roof shall cover
My limbs with dust and worms under and over
So let Oblivion hide this grief . . . the air
Closes upon my accents, as despair
Upon my heart—let death upon despair!’
He ceased, and overcome leant back awhile,
Then rising, with a melancholy smile
Went to a sofa, and lay down, and slept
A heavy sleep, and in his dreams he wept
And muttered some familiar name, and we
Wept without shame in his society.
I think I never was impressed so much;
The man who were not, must have lacked a touch
Of human nature . . . then we lingered not,
Although our argument was quite forgot,
But calling the attendants, went to dine
At Maddalo's; yet neither cheer nor wine
Could give us spirits, for we talked of him
And nothing else, till daylight made stars dim;
And we agreed his was some dreadful ill
Wrought on him boldly, yet unspeakable,
By a dear friend; some deadly change in love
Of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of;
For whose sake he, it seemed, had fixed a blot
Of falsehood on his mind which flourished not
But in the light of all-beholding truth;
And having stamped this canker on his youth
She had abandoned him—and how much more
Might be his woe, we guessed not—he had store
Of friends and fortune once, as we could guess
From his nice habits and his gentleness;
These were now lost . . . it were a grief indeed
If he had changed one unsustaining reed
For all that such a man might else adorn.
The colours of his mind seemed yet unworn;
For the wild language of his grief was high,
Such as in measure were called poetry;
And I remember one remark which then
Maddalo made. He said: ‘Most wretched men
Are cradled into poetry by wrong,
They learn in suffering what they teach in song.’
If I had been an unconnected man
I, from this moment, should have formed some plan
Never to leave sweet Venice,—for to me
It was delight to ride by the lone sea;
And then, the town is silent—one may write
Or read in gondolas by day or night,
Having the little brazen lamp alight,
Unseen, uninterrupted; books are there,
Pictures, and casts from all those statues fair
Which were twin-born with poetry, and all
We seek in towns, with little to recall
Regrets for the green country. I might sit
In Maddalo's great palace, and his wit
And subtle talk would cheer the winter night
And make me know myself, and the firelight
Would flash upon our faces, till the day
Might dawn and make me wonder at my stay:
But I had friends in London too: the chief
Attraction here, was that I sought relief
From the deep tenderness that maniac wrought
Within me—'twas perhaps an idle thought—
But I imagined that if day by day
I watched him, and but seldom went away,
And studied all the beatings of his heart
With zeal, as men study some stubborn art
For their own good, and could by patience find
An entrance to the caverns of his mind,
I might reclaim him from his dark estate:
In friendships I had been most fortunate—
Yet never saw I one whom I would call
More willingly my friend; and this was all
Accomplished not; such dreams of baseless good
Oft come and go in crowds or solitude
And leave no trace—but what I now designed
Made for long years impression on my mind.
The following morning, urged by my affairs,
I left bright Venice.
After many years
And many changes I returned; the name
Of Venice, and its aspect, was the same;
But Maddalo was travelling far away
Among the mountains of Armenia.
His dog was dead. His child had now become
A woman; such as it has been my doom
To meet with few,—a wonder of this earth,
Where there is little of transcendent worth,—
Like one of Shakespeare's women: kindly she,
And, with a manner beyond courtesy,
Received her father's friend; and when I asked
Of the lorn maniac, she her memory tasked,
And told as she had heard the mournful tale:
‘That the poor sufferer's health began to fail
Two years from my departure, but that then
The lady who had left him, came again.
Her mien had been imperious, but she now
Looked meek—perhaps remorse had brought her low.
Her coming made him better, and they stayed
Together at my father's—for I played,
As I remember, with the lady's shawl—
I might be six years old—but after all
She left him’ . . . ‘Why, her heart must have been tough:
How did it end?’ ‘And was not this enough?
They met—they parted’—‘Child, is there no more?’
‘Something within that interval which bore
The stamp of why they parted, how they met:
Yet if thine agèd eyes disdain to wet
Those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears,
Ask me no more, but let the silent years
Be closed and cered over their memory
As yon mute marble where their corpses lie.’
I urged and questioned still, she told me how
All happened—but the cold world shall not know.
‘Alas, love!
Fear me not . . . against thee I would not move
A finger in despite. Do I not live
That thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve?
I give thee tears for scorn and love for hate;
And that thy lot may be less desolate
Than his on whom thou tramplest, I refrain
From that sweet sleep which medicines all pain.

From the deep tenderness that maniac wrought
Within me—'twas perhaps an idle thought—
But I imagined that if day by day
I watched him, and but seldom went away,
And studied all the beatings of his heart
With zeal, as men study some stubborn art
For their own good, and could by patience find
An entrance to the caverns of his mind,
I might reclaim him from his dark estate:
In friendships I had been most fortunate—
Yet never saw I one whom I would call
More willingly my friend; and this was all
Accomplished not; such dreams of baseless good
Oft come and go in crowds or solitude
And leave no trace—but what I now designed
Made for long years impression on my mind.
The following morning, urged by my affairs,
I left bright Venice.
After many years
And many changes I returned; the name
Of Venice, and its aspect, was the same;
But Maddalo was travelling far away
Among the mountains of Armenia.
His dog was dead. His child had now become
A woman; such as it has been my doom
To meet with few,—a wonder of this earth,
Where there is little of transcendent worth,—
Like one of Shakespeare's women: kindly she,
And, with a manner beyond courtesy,
Received her father's friend; and when I asked
Of the lorn maniac, she her memory tasked,
And told as she had heard the mournful tale:
‘That the poor sufferer's health began to fail
Two years from my departure, but that then
The lady who had left him, came again.
Her mien had been imperious, but she now
Looked meek—perhaps remorse had brought her low.
Her coming made him better, and they stayed
Together at my father's—for I played,
As I remember, with the lady's shawl—
I might be six years old—but after all
She left him’ . . . ‘Why, her heart must have been tough:
How did it end?’ ‘And was not this enough?
They met—they parted’—‘Child, is there no more?’
‘Something within that interval which bore
The stamp of why they parted, how they met:
Yet if thine agèd eyes disdain to wet
Those wrinkled cheeks with youth's remembered tears,
Ask me no more, but let the silent years
Be closed and cered over their memory
As yon mute marble where their corpses lie.’
I urged and questioned still, she told me how
All happened—but the cold world shall not know.



Follow to the deep wood's weeds,
Follow to the wild-briar dingle,
Where we seek to intermingle,
And the violet tells her tale
To the odour-scented gale,
For they two have enough to do
Of such work as I and you.



Faint with love, the Lady of the South
    Lay in the paradise of Lebanon
Under a heaven of cedar boughs: the drouth
    Of love was on her lips; the light was gone
Out of her eyes—[....]



Where art thou, beloved To-morrow?
    When young and old, and strong and weak,
Rich and poor, through joy and sorrow,
    Thy sweet smiles we ever seek,—
In thy place—ah! well-a-day!
We find the thing we fled—To-day.



Men of England, wherefore plough
For the lords who lay ye low?
Wherefore weave with toil and care
The rich robes your tyrants wear?
Wherefore feed, and clothe, and save,
From the cradle to the grave,
Those ungrateful drones who would
Drain your sweat—nay, drink your blood?
Wherefore, Bees of England, forge
Many a weapon, chain, and scourge,
That these stingless drones may spoil
The forced produce of your toil?
Have ye leisure, comfort, calm,
Shelter, food, love's gentle balm?
Or what is it ye buy so dear
With your pain and with your fear?
The seed ye sow, another reaps;
The wealth ye find, another keeps;
The robes ye weave, another wears;
The arms ye forge, another bears.
Sow seed,—but let no tyrant reap;
Find wealth,—let no impostor heap;
Weave robes,—let not the idle wear;
Forge arms,—in your defence to bear.
Shrink to your cellars, holes, and cells;
In halls ye deck another dwells.
Why shake the chains ye wrought? Ye see
The steel ye tempered glance on ye.
With plough and spade, and hoe and loom,
Trace your grave, and build your tomb,
And weave your winding-sheet, till fair
England be your sepulchre.



    A cat in distress,
    Nothing more, nor less;
Good folks, I must faithfully tell ye,
    As I am a sinner,
    It waits for some dinner
To stuff out its own little belly.
    You would not easily guess
    All the modes of distress
Which torture the tenants of earth;
    And the various evils,
    Which like so many devils,
Attend the poor souls from their birth.
    Some a living require,
    And others desire
An old fellow out of the way;
    And which is the best
    I leave to be guessed,
For I cannot pretend to say.
    One wants society,
    Another variety,
Others a tranquil life;
    Some want food,
    Others, as good,
Only want a wife.
    But this poor little cat
    Only wanted a rat,
To stuff out its own little maw;
    And it were as good
    Some people had such food,
To make them hold their jaw!



My head is wild with weeping for a grief
    Which is the shadow of a gentle mind.
I walk into the air (but no relief
    To seek,—or haply, if I sought, to find;
It came unsought);—to wonder that a chief
    Among men's spirits should be cold and blind.



One sung of thee who left the tale untold,
    Like the false dawns which perish in the bursting;
Like empty cups of wrought and daedal gold,
    Which mock the lips with air, when they are thirsting.



Fierce roars the midnight storm
    O'er the wild mountain,
Dark clouds the night deform,
    Swift rolls the fountain—
See! o'er yon rocky height,
    Dim mists are flying—
See by the moon's pale light,
    Poor Laura's dying!
Shame and remorse shall howl,
    By her false pillow—
Fiercer than storms that roll,
    O'er the white billow;
No hand her eyes to close,
    When life is flying,
But she will find repose,
    For Laura's dying!
Then will I seek my love,
    Then will I cheer her,
Then my esteem will prove,
    When no friend is near her.
On her grave I will lie,
    When life is parted,
On her grave I will die,
    For the false hearted.



Alas, good friend, what profit can you see
In hating such a hateless thing as me?
There is no sport in hate where all the rage
Is on one side: in vain would you assuage
Your frowns upon an unresisting smile,
In which not even contempt lurks to beguile
Your heart, by some faint sympathy of hate.
Oh, conquer what you cannot satiate!
For to your passion I am far more coy
Than ever yet was coldest maid or boy
In winter noon. Of your antipathy
If I am the Narcissus, you are free
To pine into a sound with hating me.



Orphan Hours, the Year is dead,
    Come and sigh, come and weep!
Merry Hours, smile instead,
    For the Year is but asleep.
See, it smiles as it is sleeping,
Mocking your untimely weeping.
As an earthquake rocks a corse
    In its coffin in the clay,
So White Winter, that rough nurse,
    Rocks the death-cold Year to-day;
Solemn Hours! wail aloud
For your mother in her shroud.
As the wild air stirs and sways
    The tree-swung cradle of a child,
So the breath of these rude days
    Rocks the Year:—be calm and mild,
Trembling Hours, she will arise
With new love within her eyes.
January gray is here,
    Like a sexton by her grave;
February bears the bier,
    March with grief doth howl and rave,
And April weeps—but, O ye Hours!
Follow with May's fairest flowers.



Far, far away, O ye
Halcyons of Memory.
Seek some far calmer nest
Than this abandoned breast!
No news of your false spring
To my heart's winter bring,
Once having gone, in vain
    Ye come again.
Vultures, who build your bowers
High in the Future's towers,
Withered hopes on hopes are spread!
Dying joys, choked by the dead,
Will serve your beaks for prey
    Many a day.



For my dagger is bathed in the blood of the brave,
I come, care-worn tenant of life, from the grave,
Where Innocence sleeps 'neath the peace-giving sod,
And the good cease to tremble at Tyranny's nod;
I offer a calm habitation to thee,—
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?
My mansion is damp, cold silence is there,
But it lulls in oblivion the fiends of despair;
Not a groan of regret, not a sigh, not a breath,
Dares dispute with grim Silence the empire of Death,
I offer a calm habitation to thee,—
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?
Mine eyelids are heavy; my soul seeks repose,
It longs in thy cells to embosom its woes,
It longs in thy cells to deposit its load,
Where no longer the scorpions of Perfidy goad,—
Where the phantoms of Prejudice vanish away,
And Bigotry's bloodhounds lose scent of their prey.
Yet tell me, dark Death, when thine empire is o'er,
What awaits on Futurity's mist-covered shore?
Cease, cease, wayward Mortal! I dare not unveil
The shadows that float o'er Eternity's vale;
Nought waits for the good but a spirit of Love,
That will hail their blest advent to regions above.
For Love, Mortal, gleams through the gloom of my sway,
And the shades which surround me fly fast at its ray.
Hast thou loved?—Then depart from these regions of hate,
And in slumber with me blunt the arrows of fate.
I offer a calm habitation to thee,—
Say, victim of grief, wilt thou slumber with me?
Oh! sweet is thy slumber! oh! sweet is the ray
Which after thy night introduces the day;
How concealed, how persuasive, self-interest's breath,
Though it floats to mine ear from the bosom of Death!
I hoped that I quite was forgotten by all,
Yet a lingering friend might be grieved at my fall,
And duty forbids, though I languish to die,
When departure might heave Virtue's breast with a sigh.
O Death! O my friend! snatch this form to thy shrine,
And I fear, dear destroyer, I shall not repine.



Hopes, that swell in youthful breasts,
    Live not through the waste of time!
Love's rose a host of thorns invests;
    Cold, ungenial is the clime,
    Where its honours blow.
Youth says, ‘The purple flowers are mine,’
    Which die the while they glow.
Dear the boon to Fancy given,
    Retracted whilst it's granted:
Sweet the rose which lives in Heaven,
    Although on earth 'tis planted,
    Where its honours blow,
While by earth's slaves the leaves are riven
    Which die the while they glow.
Age cannot Love destroy,
    But perfidy can blast the flower,
    Even when in most unwary hour
    It blooms in Fancy's bower.
Age cannot Love destroy,
But perfidy can rend the shrine
In which its vermeil splendours shine.



What men gain fairly—that they should possess,
And children may inherit idleness,
From him who earns it—This is understood;
Private injustice may be general good.
But he who gains by base and armèd wrong,
Or guilty fraud, or base compliances,
May be despoiled; even as a stolen dress
Is stripped from a convicted thief, and he
Left in the nakedness of infamy.



Palace-roof of cloudless nights!
Paradise of golden lights!
    Deep, immeasurable, vast,
Which art now, and which wert then
    Of the Present and the Past,
Of the eternal Where and When,
    Presence-chamber, temple, home,
    Ever-canopying dome,
    Of acts and ages yet to come!
Glorious shapes have life in thee,
Earth, and all earth's company;
    Living globes which ever throng
Thy deep chasms and wildernesses;
    And green worlds that glide along;
And swift stars with flashing tresses;
    And icy moons most cold and bright,
    And mighty suns beyond the night,
    Atoms of intensest light.
Even thy name is as a god,
Heaven! for thou art the abode
    Of that Power which is the glass
Wherein man his nature sees.
    Generations as they pass
Worship thee with bended knees.
    Their unremaining gods and they
    Like a river roll away:
    Thou remainest such—alway!—
Palace-roof of cloudless nights!
Paradise of golden lights!
    Deep, immeasurable, vast,
Which art now, and which wert then
    Of the Present and the Past,
Of the eternal Where and When,

    Ever-canopying dome,
    Of acts and ages yet to come!

    Generations as they pass
Worship thee with bended knees.
    Their unremaining gods and they
    Like a river roll away:
    Thou remainest such—alway!—
Thou art but the mind's first chamber,
Round which its young fancies clamber,
    Like weak insects in a cave,
Lighted up by stalactites;
    But the portal of the grave,
Where a world of new delights
    Will make thy best glories seem
    But a dim and noonday gleam
    From the shadow of a dream!
Thou art but the mind's first chamber,

Lighted up by stalactites;
    But the portal of the grave,
Where a world of new delights

    But a dim and noonday gleam
    From the shadow of a dream!
Peace! the abyss is wreathed with scorn
At your presumption, atom-born!
    What is Heaven? and what are ye
Who its brief expanse inherit?
    What are suns and spheres which flee
With the instinct of that Spirit
    Of which ye are but a part?
    Drops which Nature's mighty heart
    Drives through thinnest veins! Depart!
What is Heaven? a globe of dew,
Filling in the morning new
    Some eyed flower whose young leaves waken
On an unimagined world:
    Constellated suns unshaken,
Orbits measureless, are furled
    In that frail and fading sphere,
    With ten millions gathered there,
    To tremble, gleam, and disappear.

The fiery mountains answer each other;
    Their thunderings are echoed from zone to zone;
The tempestuous oceans awake one another,
    And the ice-rocks are shaken round Winter's throne,
        When the clarion of the Typhoon is blown.
From a single cloud the lightening flashes,
    Whilst a thousand isles are illumined around,
Earthquake is trampling one city to ashes,
    An hundred are shuddering and tottering; the sound
        Is bellowing underground.
But keener thy gaze than the lightening's glare,
    And swifter thy step than the earthquake's tramp;
Thou deafenest the rage of the ocean; thy stare
    Makes blind the volcanoes; the sun's bright lamp
        To thine is a fen-fire damp.
From billow and mountain and exhalation
    The sunlight is darted through vapour and blast;
From spirit to spirit, from nation to nation,
    From city to hamlet thy dawning is cast,—
And tyrants and slaves are like shadows of night
        In the van of the morning light.



    Art thou pale for weariness
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the earth,
    Wandering companionless
Among the stars that have a different birth,—
And ever changing, like a joyless eye
That finds no object worth its constancy?
Thou chosen sister of the Spirit,
That gazes on thee till in thee it pities [....]



The warm sun is failing, the bleak wind is wailing,
The bare boughs are sighing, the pale flowers are dying,
        And the Year
On the earth her death-bed, in a shroud of leaves dead,
            Is lying.
    Come, Months, come away,
    From November to May,
    In your saddest array;
    Follow the bier
    Of the dead cold Year,
And like dim shadows watch by her sepulchre.
The chill rain is falling, the nipped worm is crawling,
The rivers are swelling, the thunder is knelling
        For the Year;
The blithe swallows are flown, and the lizards each gone
            To his dwelling;
    Come, Months, come away;
    Put on white, black, and gray;
    Let your light sisters play—
    Ye, follow the bier
    Of the dead cold Year,
And make her grave green with tear on tear.



Why is it said thou canst not live
    In a youthful breast and fair,
Since thou eternal life canst give,
    Canst bloom for ever there?
Since withering pain no power possessed,
    Nor age, to blanch thy vermeil hue,
Nor time's dread victor, death, confessed,
    Though bathed with his poison dew,
Still thou retain'st unchanging bloom,
Fixed tranquil, even in the tomb.
And oh! when on the blest, reviving,
    The day-star dawns of love,
Each energy of soul surviving
    More vivid, soars above,
Hast thou ne'er felt a rapturous thrill,
    Like June's warm breath, athwart thee fly,
O'er each idea then to steal,
    When other passions die?
Felt it in some wild noonday dream,
When sitting by the lonely stream,
Where Silence says, ‘Mine is the dell’;
    And not a murmur from the plain,
And not an echo from the fell,
    Disputes her silent reign.



Amid the desolation of a city,
Which was the cradle, and is now the grave
Of an extinguished people,—so that Pity
Weeps o'er the shipwrecks of Oblivion's wave,
There stands the Tower of Famine. It is built
Upon some prison-homes, whose dwellers rave
For bread, and gold, and blood: Pain, linked to Guilt,
Agitates the light flame of their hours,
Until its vital oil is spent or spilt.
There stands the pile, a tower amid the towers
And sacred domes; each marble-ribbèd roof,
The brazen-gated temples, and the bowers
Of solitary wealth,—the tempest-proof
Pavilions of the dark Italian air,—
Are by its presence dimmed—they stand aloof,
And are withdrawn—so that the world is bare;
As if a spectre wrapped in shapeless terror
Amid a company of ladies fair
Should glide and glow, till it became a mirror
Of all their beauty, and their hair and hue,
The life of their sweet eyes, with all its error,
Should be absorbed, till they to marble grew.



Alas! this is not what I thought life was.
I knew that there were crimes and evil men,
Misery and hate; nor did I hope to pass
Untouched by suffering, through the rugged glen.
In mine own heart I saw as in a glass
The hearts of others [....] And when
I went among my kind, with triple brass
Of calm endurance my weak breast I armed,
To bear scorn, fear, and hate, a woful mass!



Unrisen splendour of the brightest sun,
To rise upon our darkness, if the star
Now beckoning thee out of thy misty throne
Could thaw the clouds which wage an obscure war
With thy young brightness!



Thou art fair, and few are fairer
    Of the Nymphs of earth or ocean;
They are robes that fit the wearer—
    Those soft limbs of thine, whose motion
Ever falls and shifts and glances
As the life within them dances.
Thy deep eyes, a double Planet,
    Gaze the wisest into madness
With soft clear fire,—the winds that fan it
    Are those thoughts of tender gladness
Which, like zephyrs on the billow,
Make thy gentle soul their pillow.
If, whatever face thou paintest
    In those eyes, grows pale with pleasure,
If the fainting soul is faintest
    When it hears thy harp's wild measure,
Wonder not that when thou speakest
Of the weak my heart is weakest.
As dew beneath the wind of morning,
    As the sea which whirlwinds waken,
As the birds at thunder's warning,
    As aught mute yet deeply shaken,
As one who feels an unseen spirit
Is my heart when thine is near it.



As I lay asleep in Italy
There came a voice from over the Sea,
And with great power it forth led me
To walk in the visions of Poesy.
I met Murder on the way—
He had a mask like Castlereagh—
Very smooth he looked, yet grim;
Seven blood-hounds followed him:
All were fat; and well they might
Be in admirable plight,
For one by one, and two by two,
He tossed them human hearts to chew
Which from his wide cloak he drew.
Next came Fraud, and he had on,
Like Eldon, an ermined gown;
His big tears, for he wept well,
Turned to mill-stones as they fell.
And the little children, who
Round his feet played to and fro,
Thinking every tear a gem,
Had their brains knocked out by them.
Clothed with the Bible, as with light,
And the shadows of the night,
Like Sidmouth, next, Hypocrisy
On a crocodile rode by.
And many more Destructions played
In this ghastly masquerade,
All disguised, even to the eyes,
Like Bishops, lawyers, peers, or spies.
Last came Anarchy: he rode
On a white horse, splashed with blood;
He was pale even to the lips,
Like Death in the Apocalypse.
And he wore a kingly crown;
And in his grasp a sceptre shone;
On his brow this mark I saw—
‘I am God, and King, and Law!’
With a pace stately and fast,
Over English land he passed,
Trampling to a mire of blood
The adoring multitude.
And a mighty troop around,
With their trampling shook the ground,
Waving each a bloody sword,
For the service of their Lord.
And with glorious triumph, they
Rode through England proud and gay,
Drunk as with intoxication
Of the wine of desolation.
O'er fields and towns, from sea to sea,
Passed the Pageant swift and free,
Tearing up, and trampling down;
Till they came to London town.
And each dweller, panic-stricken,
Felt his heart with terror sicken
Hearing the tempestuous cry
Of the triumph of Anarchy.
For with pomp to meet him came,
Clothed in arms like blood and flame,
The hired murderers, who did sing
‘Thou art God, and Law, and King.
‘We have waited, weak and lone
For thy coming, Mighty One!
Our purses are empty, our swords are cold,
Give us glory, and blood, and gold.’
Lawyers and priests, a motley crowd,
To the earth their pale brows bowed;
Like a bad prayer not over loud,
Whispering—‘Thou art Law and God.’—
Then all cried with one accord,
‘Thou art King, and God, and Lord;
Anarchy, to thee we bow,
Be thy name made holy now!’
And Anarchy, the Skeleton,
Bowed and grinned to every one,
As well as if his education
Had cost ten millions to the nation.
For he knew the Palaces
Of our Kings were rightly his;
His the sceptre, crown, and globe,
And the gold-inwoven robe.
So he sent his slaves before
To seize upon the Bank and Tower,
And was proceeding with intent
To meet his pensioned Parliament
When one fled past, a maniac maid,
And her name was Hope, she said:
But she looked more like Despair,
And she cried out in the air:
‘My father Time is weak and gray
With waiting for a better day;
See how idiot-like he stands,
Fumbling with his palsied hands!
‘He has had child after child,
And the dust of death is piled
Over every one but me—
Misery, oh, Misery!’
Then she lay down in the street,
Right before the horses' feet,
Expecting, with a patient eye,
Murder, Fraud, and Anarchy.
When between her and her foes
A mist, a light, an image rose,
Small at first, and weak, and frail
Like the vapour of a vale:
Till as clouds grow on the blast,
Like tower-crowned giants striding fast,
And glare with lightnings as they fly,
And speak in thunder to the sky,
It grew—a Shape arrayed in mail
Brighter than the viper's scale,
And upborne on wings whose grain
Was as the light of sunny rain.
On its helm, seen far away,
A planet, like the Morning's, lay;
And those plumes its light rained through
Like a shower of crimson dew.
With step as soft as wind it passed
O'er the heads of men—so fast
That they knew the presence there,
And looked,—but all was empty air.
As flowers beneath May's footstep waken,
As stars from Night's loose hair are shaken,
As waves arise when loud winds call,
Thoughts sprung where'er that step did fall.
And the prostrate multitude
Looked-and ankle-deep in blood,
Hope, that maiden most serene,
Was walking with a quiet mien:
And Anarchy, the ghastly birth,
Lay dead earth upon the earth;
The Horse of Death tameless as wind
Fled, and with his hoofs did grind
To dust the murderers thronged behind.
A rushing light of clouds and splendour,
A sense awakening and yet tender
Was heard and felt—and at its close
These words of joy and fear arose
As if their own indignant Earth
Which gave the sons of England birth
Had felt their blood upon her brow,
And shuddering with a mother's throe
Had turnèd every drop of blood
By which her face had been bedewed
To an accent unwithstood,—
As if her heart had cried aloud:
‘Men of England, heirs of Glory,
Heroes of unwritten story,
Nurslings of one mighty Mother,
Hopes of her, and one another;
‘Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number,
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you—
Ye are many—they are few.
‘What is Freedom?—ye can tell
That which slavery is, too well—
For its very name has grown
To an echo of your own.
‘'Tis to work and have such pay
As just keeps life from day to day
In your limbs, as in a cell
For the tyrants' use to dwell,
‘So that ye for them are made
Loom, and plough, and sword, and spade,
With or without your own will bent
To their defence and nourishment.
‘'Tis to see your children weak
With their mothers pine and peak,
When the winter winds are bleak,—
They are dying whilst I speak.
‘'Tis to hunger for such diet
As the rich man in his riot
Casts to the fat dogs that lie
Surfeiting beneath his eye;
‘'Tis to let the Ghost of Gold
Take from Toil a thousandfold
More than e'er its substance could
In the tyrannies of old.
‘Paper coin—that forgery
Of the title-deeds, which ye
Hold to something of the worth
Of the inheritance of Earth.
‘'Tis to be a slave in soul
And to hold no strong control
Over your own wills, but be
All that others make of ye.
‘And at length when ye complain
With a murmur weak and vain
'Tis to see the Tyrant's crew
Ride over your wives and you—
Blood is on the grass like dew.
‘Then it is to feel revenge
Fiercely thirsting to exchange
Blood for blood—and wrong for wrong—
Do not thus when ye are strong.
‘Birds find rest, in narrow nest
When weary of their wingèd quest;
Beasts find fare, in woody lair
When storm and snow are in the air .
‘Asses, swine, have litter spread
And with fitting food are fed;
All things have a home but one—
Thou, Oh, Englishman, hast none!
‘This is Slavery—savage men,
Or wild beasts within a den
Would endure not as ye do—
But such ills they never knew.
‘What art thou Freedom? O! could slaves
Answer from their living graves
This demand—tyrants would flee
Like a dream's dim imagery:
‘Thou art not, as impostors say,
A shadow soon to pass away,
A superstition, and a name
Echoing from the cave of Fame.
‘For the labourer thou art bread,
And a comely table spread
From his daily labour come
In a neat and happy home.
‘Thou art clothes, and fire, and food
For the trampled multitude—
No—in countries that are free
Such starvation cannot be
As in England now we see.
‘To the rich thou art a check,
When his foot is on the neck
Of his victim, thou dost make
That he treads upon a snake.
‘Thou art Justice—ne'er for gold
May thy righteous laws be sold
As laws are in England—thou
Shield'st alike the high and low.
‘Thou art Wisdom—Freemen never
Dream that God will damn for ever
All who think those things untrue
Of which Priests make such ado.
‘Thou art Peace—never by thee
Would blood and treasure wasted be
As tyrants wasted them, when all
Leagued to quench thy flame in Gaul.
‘What if English toil and blood
Was poured forth, even as a flood?
It availed, Oh, Liberty,
To dim, but not extinguish thee.
‘Thou art Love—the rich have kissed
Thy feet, and like him following Christ,
Give their substance to the free
And through the rough world follow thee,
‘Or turn their wealth to arms, and make
War for thy belovèd sake
On wealth, and war, and fraud—whence they
Drew the power which is their prey.
‘Science, Poetry, and Thought
Are thy lamps; they make the lot
Of the dwellers in a cot
So serene, they curse it not.
‘Spirit, Patience, Gentleness,
All that can adorn and bless
Art thou—let deeds, not words, express
Thine exceeding loveliness.
‘Let a great Assembly be
Of the fearless and the free
On some spot of English ground
Where the plains stretch wide around.
‘Let the blue sky overhead,
The green earth on which ye tread,
All that must eternal be
Witness the solemnity.
‘From the corners uttermost
Of the bounds of English coast;
From every hut, village, and town
Where those who live and suffer moan
For others' misery or their own ,
‘From the workhouse and the prison
Where pale as corpses newly risen,
Women, children, young and old
Groan for pain, and weep for cold—
‘From the haunts of daily life
Where is waged the daily strife
With common wants and common cares
Which sows the human heart with tares—
‘Lastly from the palaces
Where the murmur of distress
Echoes, like the distant sound
Of a wind alive around
‘Those prison halls of wealth and fashion,
Where some few feel such compassion
For those who groan, and toil, and wail
As must make their brethren pale—
‘Ye who suffer woes untold,
Or to feel, or to behold
Your lost country bought and sold
With a price of blood and gold—
‘Let a vast assembly be,
And with great solemnity
Declare with measured words that ye
Are, as God has made ye, free—
‘Be your strong and simple words
Keen to wound as sharpened swords,
And wide as targes let them be,
With their shade to cover ye.
‘Let the tyrants pour around
With a quick and startling sound,
Like the loosening of a sea,
Troops of armed emblazonry.
‘Let the charged artillery drive
Till the dead air seems alive
With the clash of clanging wheels,
And the tramp of horses' heels.
‘Let the fixèd bayonet
Gleam with sharp desire to wet
Its bright point in English blood
Looking keen as one for food.
‘Let the horsemen's scimitars
Wheel and flash, like sphereless stars
Thirsting to eclipse their burning
In a sea of death and mourning.
‘Stand ye calm and resolute,
Like a forest close and mute,
With folded arms and looks which are
Weapons of unvanquished war,
‘And let Panic, who outspeeds
The career of armèd steeds
Pass, a disregarded shade
Through your phalanx undismayed.
‘Let the laws of your own land,
Good or ill, between ye stand
Hand to hand, and foot to foot,
Arbiters of the dispute,
‘The old laws of England—they
Whose reverend heads with age are gray,
Children of a wiser day;
And whose solemn voice must be
Thine own echo—Liberty!
‘On those who first should violate
Such sacred heralds in their state
Rest the blood that must ensue,
And it will not rest on you.
‘And if then the tyrants dare
Let them ride among you there,
Slash, and stab, and maim, and hew,—
What they like, that let them do.
‘With folded arms and steady eyes,
And little fear, and less surprise,
Look upon them as they slay
Till their rage has died away.
‘Then they will return with shame
To the place from which they came,
And the blood thus shed will speak
In hot blushes on their cheek.
‘Every woman in the land
Will point at them as they stand—
They will hardly dare to greet
Their acquaintance in the street.
‘And the bold, true warriors
Who have hugged Danger in wars
Will turn to those who would be free,
Ashamed of such base company.
‘And that slaughter to the Nation
Shall steam up like inspiration,
Eloquent, oracular;
A volcano heard afar.
‘And these words shall then become
Like Oppression's thundered doom
Ringing through each heart and brain,
Heard again—again—again—
‘Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number—
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you—
Ye are many—they are few.’



And Peter Bell, when he had been
    With fresh-imported Hell-fire warmed,
Grew serious—from his dress and mien
'Twas very plainly to be seen
    Peter was quite reformed.
His eyes turned up, his mouth turned down;
    His accent caught a nasal twang;
He oiled his hair ; there might be heard
The grace of God in every word
    Which Peter said or sang.
But Peter now grew old, and had
    An ill no doctor could unravel;
His torments almost drove him mad;—
Some said it was a fever bad—
    Some swore it was the gravel.
His holy friends then came about,
    And with long preaching and persuasion
Convinced the patient that, without
The smallest shadow of a doubt,
    He was predestined to damnation.
They said—‘Thy name is Peter Bell;
    Thy skin is of a brimstone hue;
Alive or dead—ay, sick or well—
The one God made to rhyme with hell;
    The other, I think, rhymes with you.’
Then Peter set up such a yell!—
    The nurse, who with some water gruel
Was climbing up the stairs, as well
As her old legs could climb them—fell,
    And broke them both—the fall was cruel.
The Parson from the casement lept
    Into the lake of Windermere—
And many an eel—though no adept
In God's right reason for it—kept
    Gnawing his kidneys half a year.
And all the rest rushed through the door,
    And tumbled over one another,
And broke their skulls.—Upon the floor
Meanwhile sat Peter Bell, and swore,
    And cursed his father and his mother;
And raved of God, and sin, and death,
    Blaspheming like an infidel;
And said, that with his clenchèd teeth
He'd seize the earth from underneath,
    And drag it with him down to hell.
As he was speaking came a spasm,
    And wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder;
Like one who sees a strange phantasm
He lay,—there was a silent chasm
    Between his upper jaw and under.
And yellow death lay on his face;
    And a fixed smile that was not human
Told, as I understand the case,
That he was gone to the wrong place:—
    I heard all this from the old woman.
Then there came down from Langdale Pike
    A cloud, with lightning, wind and hail;
It swept over the mountains like
An ocean,—and I heard it strike
    The woods and crags of Grasmere vale.
And I saw the black storm come
    Nearer, minute after minute;
Its thunder made the cataracts dumb;
With hiss, and clash, and hollow hum,
    It neared as if the Devil was in it.
The Devil was in it:—he had bought
    Peter for half-a-crown; and when
The storm which bore him vanished, nought
That in the house that storm had caught
    Was ever seen again.
The gaping neighbours came next day—
    They found all vanished from the shore:
The Bible, whence he used to pray,
Half scorched under a hen-coop lay;
    Smashed glass—and nothing more!
The Devil, I safely can aver,
    Has neither hoof, nor tail, nor sting;
Nor is he, as some sages swear,
A spirit, neither here nor there,
    In nothing—yet in everything.
He is—what we are; for sometimes
    The Devil is a gentleman;
At others a bard bartering rhymes
For sack; a statesman spinning crimes;
    A swindler, living as he can;
A thief, who cometh in the night,
    With whole boots and net pantaloons,
Like some one whom it were not right
To mention;—or the luckless wight
    From whom he steals nine silver spoons.
But in this case he did appear
    Like a slop-merchant from Wapping,
And with smug face, and eye severe,
On every side did perk and peer
    Till he saw Peter dead or napping.
He had on an upper Benjamin
    (For he was of the driving schism)
In the which he wrapped his skin
From the storm he travelled in,
    For fear of rheumatism.
He called the ghost out of the corse;—
    It was exceedingly like Peter,—
Only its voice was hollow and hoarse—
It had a queerish look of course—
    Its dress too was a little neater.
The Devil knew not his name and lot;
    Peter knew not that he was Bell:
Each had an upper stream of thought,
Which made all seem as it was not;
    Fitting itself to all things well.
Peter thought he had parents dear,
    Brothers, sisters, cousins, cronies,
In the fens of Lincolnshire;
He perhaps had found them there
    Had he gone and boldly shown his
Solemn phiz in his own village;
    Where he thought oft when a boy
He'd clomb the orchard walls to pillage
The produce of his neighbour's tillage,
    With marvellous pride and joy.
And the Devil thought he had,
    'Mid the misery and confusion
Of an unjust war, just made
A fortune by the gainful trade
Of giving soldiers rations bad—
    The world is full of strange delusion—
That he had a mansion planned
    In a square like Grosvenor Square,
That he was aping fashion, and
That he now came to Westmoreland
    To see what was romantic there.
And all this, though quite ideal,—
    Ready at a breath to vanish,—
Was a state not more unreal
Than the peace he could not feel,
    Or the care he could not banish.
After a little conversation,
    The Devil told Peter, if he chose,
He'd bring him to the world of fashion
By giving him a situation
    In his own service—and new clothes.
And Peter bowed, quite pleased and proud,
    And after waiting some few days
For a new livery—dirty yellow
Turned up with black—the wretched fellow
    Was bowled to Hell in the Devil's chaise.
Hell is a city much like London—
    A populous and a smoky city;
There are all sorts of people undone,
And there is little or no fun done;
    Small justice shown, and still less pity.
There is a Castles, and a Canning,
    A Cobbett, and a Castlereagh;
All sorts of caitiff corpses planning
All sorts of cozening for trepanning
    Corpses less corrupt than they.
There is a , who has lost
    His wits, or sold them, none knows which;
He walks about a double ghost,
And though as thin as Fraud almost—
    Ever grows more grim and rich.
There is a Chancery Court; a King;
    A manufacturing mob; a set
Of thieves who by themselves are sent
Similar thieves to represent;
    An army; and a public debt.
Which last is a scheme of paper money,
    And means—being interpreted—
‘Bees, keep your wax—give us the honey,
And we will plant, while skies are sunny,
    Flowers, which in winter serve instead.’
There is a great talk of revolution—
    And a great chance of despotism—
German soldiers—camps—confusion—
Tumults—lotteries—rage—delusion—
    Gin—suicide—and methodism;
Taxes too, on wine and bread,
    And meat, and beer, and tea, and cheese,
From which those patriots pure are fed,
Who gorge before they reel to bed
    The tenfold essence of all these.
There are mincing women, mewing,
    (Like cats, who amant miserè ,)
Of their own virtue, and pursuing
Their gentler sisters to that ruin,
    Without which—what were chastity? 


Lawyers—judges—old hobnobbers
    Are there—bailiffs—chancellors—
Bishops—great and little robbers—
Rhymesters—pamphleteers—stock-jobbers—
    Men of glory in the wars,—
Things whose trade is, over ladies
    To lean, and flirt, and stare, and simper,
Till all that is divine in woman
Grows cruel, courteous, smooth, inhuman,
    Crucified 'twixt a smile and whimper.
Thrusting, toiling, wailing, moiling,
    Frowning, preaching—such a riot!
Each with never-ceasing labour,
Whilst he thinks he cheats his neighbour,
    Cheating his own heart of quiet.
And all these meet at levees;—
    Dinners convivial and political;—
Suppers of epic poets;—teas,
Where small talk dies in agonies;—
    Breakfasts professional and critical;
Lunches and snacks so aldermanic
    That one would furnish forth ten dinners,
Where reigns a Cretan-tonguèd panic,
Lest news Russ, Dutch, or Alemannic
    Should make some losers, and some winners;—
At conversazioni—balls—
    Conventicles—and drawing-rooms—
Courts of law—committees—calls
Of a morning—clubs—book-stalls—
    Churches—masquerades—and tombs.
And this is Hell—and in this smother
    All are damnable and damned;
Each one damning, damns the other
They are damned by one another,
    By none other are they damned.
'Tis a lie to say, ‘God damns !’
    Where was Heaven's Attorney General
When they first gave out such flams?
Let there be an end of shams,
    They are mines of poisonous mineral.
Statesmen damn themselves to be
    Cursed; and lawyers damn their souls
To the auction of a fee;
Churchmen damn themselves to see
    God's sweet love in burning coals.
The rich are damned, beyond all cure,
    To taunt, and starve, and trample on
The weak and wretched; and the poor
Damn their broken hearts to endure
    Stripe on stripe, with groan on groan.
Sometimes the poor are damned indeed
    To take,—not means for being blessed,—
But Cobbett's snuff, revenge; that weed
From which the worms that it doth feed
    Squeeze less than they before possessed.
And some few, like we know who,
    Damned—but God alone knows why—
To believe their minds are given
To make this ugly Hell a Heaven;
    In which faith they live and die.
Thus, as in a town, plague-stricken,
    Each man be he sound or no
Must indifferently sicken;
As when day begins to thicken,
    None knows a pigeon from a crow,—
So good and bad, sane and mad,
    The oppressor and the oppressed;
Those who weep to see what others
Smile to inflict upon their brothers;
    Lovers, haters, worst and best;
All are damned—they breathe an air,
    Thick, infected, joy-dispelling:
Each pursues what seems most fair,
Mining like moles, through mind, and there
Scoop palace-caverns vast, where Care
    In thronèd state is ever dwelling.
Lo, Peter in Hell's Grosvenor Square,
    A footman in the Devil's service!
And the misjudging world would swear
That every man in service there
    To virtue would prefer vice.
But Peter, though now damned, was not
    What Peter was before damnation.
Men oftentimes prepare a lot
Which ere it finds them, is not what
    Suits with their genuine station.
All things that Peter saw and felt
    Had a peculiar aspect to him;
And when they came within the belt
Of his own nature, seemed to melt,
    Like cloud to cloud, into him.
And so the outward world uniting
    To that within him, he became
Considerably uninviting
To those who, meditation slighting,
    Were moulded in a different frame.
And he scorned them, and they scorned him;
    And he scorned all they did; and they
Did all that men of their own trim
Are wont to do to please their whim,
    Drinking, lying, swearing, play.
Such were his fellow-servants; thus
    His virtue, like our own, was built
Too much on that indignant fuss
Hypocrite Pride stirs up in us
    To bully one another's guilt.
He had a mind which was somehow
    At once circumference and centre
Of all he might or feel or know;
Nothing went ever out, although
    Something did ever enter.
He had as much imagination
    As a pint-pot;—he never could
Fancy another situation,
From which to dart his contemplation,
    Than that wherein he stood.
Yet his was individual mind,
    And new created all he saw
In a new manner, and refined
Those new creations, and combined
    Them, by a master-spirit's law.
Thus—though unimaginative—
    An apprehension clear, intense,
Of his mind's work, had made alive
The things it wrought on; I believe
    Wakening a sort of thought in sense.
But from the first 'twas Peter's drift
    To be a kind of moral eunuch,
He touched the hem of Nature's shift,
Felt faint—and never dared uplift
    The closest, all-concealing tunic.
She laughed the while, with an arch smile,
    And kissed him with a sister's kiss,
And said—‘My best Diogenes,
I love you well—but, if you please,
    Tempt not again my deepest bliss.
‘'Tis you are cold—for I, not coy,
    Yield love for love, frank, warm, and true;
And Burns, a Scottish peasant boy—
His errors prove it—knew my joy
    More, learnèd friend, than you.
‘Bocca bacciata non perde ventura,
    Anzi rinnuova come fa la luna:—
So thought Boccaccio, whose sweet words might cure a
Male prude, like you, from what you now endure, a
    Low-tide in soul, like a stagnant laguna.’
Then Peter rubbed his eyes severe,
    And smoothed his spacious forehead down
With his broad palm;—'twixt love and fear,
He looked, as he no doubt felt, queer,
    And in his dream sate down.
The Devil was no uncommon creature;
    A leaden-witted thief—just huddled
Out of the dross and scum of nature;
A toad-like lump of limb and feature,
    With mind, and heart, and fancy muddled.
He was that heavy, dull, cold thing,
    The spirit of evil well may be:
A drone too base to have a sting;
Who gluts, and grimes his lazy wing,
    And calls lust, luxury.
Now he was quite the kind of wight
    Round whom collect, at a fixed aera,
Venison, turtle, hock, and claret,—
Good cheer—and those who come to share it—
    And best East Indian madeira!
It was his fancy to invite
    Men of science, wit, and learning,
Who came to lend each other light;
He proudly thought that his gold's might
    Had set those spirits burning.
And men of learning, science, wit,
    Considered him as you and I
Think of some rotten tree, and sit
Lounging and dining under it,
    Exposed to the wide sky.
And all the while, with loose fat smile,
    The willing wretch sat winking there,
Believing 'twas his power that made
That jovial scene—and that all paid
    Homage to his unnoticed chair.
Though to be sure this place was Hell;
    He was the Devil—and all they—
What though the claret circled well,
And wit, like ocean, rose and fell?—
    Were damned eternally.
Among the guests who often stayed
    Till the Devil's petits-soupers,
A man there came, fair as a maid,
And Peter noted what he said,
    Standing behind his master's chair.
He was a mighty poet—and
    A subtle-souled psychologist;
All things he seemed to understand,
Of old or new—of sea or land—
    But his own mind—which was a mist.
This was a man who might have turned
    Hell into Heaven—and so in gladness
A Heaven unto himself have earned;
But he in shadows undiscerned
    Trusted,—and damned himself to madness.
He spoke of poetry, and how
    ‘Divine it was—a light—a love—
A spirit which like wind doth blow
As it listeth, to and fro;
    A dew rained down from God above;
‘A power which comes and goes like dream,
    And which none can ever trace—
Heaven's light on earth—Truth's brightest beam.’
And when he ceased there lay the gleam
    Of those words upon his face.
Now Peter, when he heard such talk,
    Would, heedless of a broken pate,
Stand like a man asleep, or balk
Some wishing guest of knife or fork,
    Or drop and break his master's plate.
At night he oft would start and wake
    Like a lover, and began
In a wild measure songs to make
On moor, and glen, and rocky lake,
    And on the heart of man—
And on the universal sky—
    And the wide earth's bosom green,—
And the sweet, strange mystery
Of what beyond these things may lie,
    And yet remain unseen.
For in his thought he visited
    The spots in which, ere dead and damned,
He his wayward life had led;
Yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed
    Which thus his fancy crammed.
And these obscure remembrances
    Stirred such harmony in Peter,
That, whensoever he should please,
He could speak of rocks and trees
    In poetic metre.
For though it was without a sense
    Of memory, yet he remembered well
Many a ditch and quick-set fence;
Of lakes he had intelligence,
    He knew something of heath and fell.
He had also dim recollections
    Of pedlars tramping on their rounds;
Milk-pans and pails; and odd collections
Of saws, and proverbs; and reflections
    Old parsons make in burying-grounds.
But Peter's verse was clear, and came
    Announcing from the frozen hearth
Of a cold age, that none might tame
The soul of that diviner flame
    It augured to the Earth:
Like gentle rains, on the dry plains,
    Making that green which late was gray,
Or like the sudden moon, that stains
Some gloomy chamber's window-panes
    With a broad light like day.
For language was in Peter's hand
    Like clay while he was yet a potter;
And he made songs for all the land,
Sweet both to feel and understand,
    As pipkins late to mountain Cotter.
And Mr. , the bookseller,
    Gave twenty pounds for some;—then scorning
A footman's yellow coat to wear,
Peter, too proud of heart, I fear,
    Instantly gave the Devil warning.
Whereat the Devil took offence,
    And swore in his soul a great oath then,
‘That for his damned impertinence
He'd bring him to a proper sense
    Of what was due to gentlemen!’
‘O that mine enemy had written
    A book!’—cried Job:—a fearful curse,
If to the Arab, as the Briton,
'Twas galling to be critic-bitten:—
    The Devil to Peter wished no worse.
When Peter's next new book found vent,
    The Devil to all the first Reviews
A copy of it slyly sent,
With five-pound note as compliment,
    And this short notice—‘Pray abuse.’
Then seriatim, month and quarter,
    Appeared such mad tirades.—One said—
‘Peter seduced Mrs. Foy's daughter,
Then drowned the mother in Ullswater,
    The last thing as he went to bed.’
Another—‘Let him shave his head!
    Where's Dr. Willis?—Or is he joking?
What does the rascal mean or hope,
No longer imitating Pope,
    In that barbarian Shakespeare poking?’
One more, ‘Is incest not enough?
    And must there be adultery too?
Grace after meat? Miscreant and Liar!
Thief! Blackguard! Scoundrel! Fool! Hell-fire
    Is twenty times too good for you.
‘By that last book of yours we think
    You've double damned yourself to scorn;
We warned you whilst yet on the brink
You stood. From your black name will shrink
    The babe that is unborn.’
All these Reviews the Devil made
    Up in a parcel, which he had
Safely to Peter's house conveyed.
For carriage, tenpence Peter paid—
    Untied them—read them—went half mad.
‘What!’ cried he, ‘this is my reward
    For nights of thought, and days of toil?
Do poets, but to be abhorred
By men of whom they never heard,
    Consume their spirits' oil?
‘What have I done to them?—and who
    Is Mrs. Foy? 'Tis very cruel
To speak of me and Betty so!
Adultery! God defend me! Oh!
    I've half a mind to fight a duel.
‘Or,’ cried he, a grave look collecting,
    ‘Is it my genius, like the moon,
Sets those who stand her face inspecting,
That face within their brain reflecting,
    Like a crazed bell-chime, out of tune?’
For Peter did not know the town,
    But thought, as country readers do,
For half a guinea or a crown,
He bought oblivion or renown
    From God's own voice  in a review.
All Peter did on this occasion
    Was, writing some sad stuff in prose.
It is a dangerous invasion
When poets criticize; their station
    Is to delight, not pose.
The Devil then sent to Leipsic fair
    For Born's translation of Kant's book;
A world of words, tail foremost, where
Right—wrong—false—true—and foul—and fair
    As in a lottery-wheel are shook.
Five thousand crammed octavo pages
    Of German psychologics,—he
Who his furor verborum assuages
Thereon, deserves just seven months' wages
    More than will e'er be due to me.
I looked on them nine several days,
    And then I saw that they were bad;
A friend, too, spoke in their dispraise,—
He never read them;—with amaze
    I found Sir William Drummond had.
When the book came, the Devil sent
    It to P. Verbovale , Esquire,
With a brief note of compliment,
By that night's Carlisle mail. It went,
    And set his soul on fire.
Fire, which ex luce praebens fumum,
    Made him beyond the bottom see
Of truth's clear well—when I and you, Ma'am,
Go, as we shall do, subter humum,
    We may know more than he.
Now Peter ran to seed in soul
    Into a walking paradox;
For he was neither part nor whole,
Nor good, nor bad—nor knave nor fool;
    —Among the woods and rocks
Furious he rode, where late he ran,
    Lashing and spurring his tame hobby;
Turned to a formal puritan,
A solemn and unsexual man,—
    He half believed White Obi.
This steed in vision he would ride,
    High trotting over nine-inch bridges,
With Flibbertigibbet, imp of pride,
Mocking and mowing by his side—
A mad-brained goblin for a guide—
    Over corn-fields, gates, and hedges.
After these ghastly rides, he came
    Home to his heart, and found from thence
Much stolen of its accustomed flame;
His thoughts grew weak, drowsy, and lame
    Of their intelligence.
To Peter's view, all seemed one hue;
    He was no Whig, he was no Tory;
No Deist and no Christian he;—
He got so subtle, that to be
    Nothing, was all his glory.
One single point in his belief
    From his organization sprung,
The heart-enrooted faith, the chief
Ear in his doctrines' blighted sheaf,
    That ‘Happiness is wrong’;
So thought Calvin and Dominic;
    So think their fierce successors, who
Even now would neither stint nor stick
Our flesh from off our bones to pick,
    If they might ‘do their do.’
His morals thus were undermined:—
    The old Peter—the hard, old Potter—
Was born anew within his mind;
He grew dull, harsh, sly, unrefined,
    As when he tramped beside the Otter .
In the death hues of agony
    Lambently flashing from a fish,
Now Peter felt amused to see
Shades like a rainbow's rise and flee,
    Mixed with a certain hungry wish .
So in his Country's dying face
    He looked—and, lovely as she lay,
Seeking in vain his last embrace,
Wailing her own abandoned case,
    With hardened sneer he turned away:
And coolly to his own soul said;—
    ‘Do you not think that we might make
A poem on her when she's dead:—
Or, no—a thought is in my head—
    Her shroud for a new sheet I'll take:
‘My wife wants one.—Let who will bury
    This mangled corpse! And I and you,
My dearest Soul, will then make merry,
As the Prince Regent did with Sherry,—’
    ‘Ay—and at last desert me too.’
And so his Soul would not be gay,
    But moaned within him; like a fawn
Moaning within a cave, it lay
Wounded and wasting, day by day,
    Till all its life of life was gone.
As troubled skies stain waters clear,
    The storm in Peter's heart and mind
Now made his verses dark and queer:
They were the ghosts of what they were,
    Shaking dim grave-clothes in the wind.
For he now raved enormous folly,
    Of Baptisms, Sunday-schools, and Graves,
'Twould make George Colman melancholy
To have heard him, like a male Molly,
    Chanting those stupid staves.
Yet the Reviews, who heaped abuse
    On Peter while he wrote for freedom,
So soon as in his song they spy
The folly which soothes tyranny,
    Praise him, for those who feed 'em.
‘He was a man, too great to scan;—
    A planet lost in truth's keen rays:—
His virtue, awful and prodigious;—
He was the most sublime, religious,
    Pure-minded Poet of these days.’
As soon as he read that, cried Peter,
    ‘Eureka! I have found the way
To make a better thing of metre
Than e'er was made by living creature
    Up to this blessèd day.’
Then Peter wrote odes to the Devil;—
    In one of which he meekly said:
‘May Carnage and Slaughter,
Thy niece and thy daughter,
May Rapine and Famine,
Thy gorge ever cramming,
    Glut thee with living and dead!
    ‘May Death and Damnation,
    And Consternation,
Flit up from Hell with pure intent!
    Slash them at Manchester,
    Glasgow, Leeds, and Chester;
Drench all with blood from Avon to Trent.
    ‘Let thy body-guard yeomen
    Hew down babes and women,
And laugh with bold triumph till Heaven be rent!
    When Moloch in Jewry
    Munched children with fury,
It was thou, Devil, dining with pure intent .’
The Devil now knew his proper cue.—
    Soon as he read the ode, he drove
To his friend Lord MacMurderchouse's,
A man of interest in both houses,
    And said:—‘For money or for love,
‘Pray find some cure or sinecure;
    To feed from the superfluous taxes
A friend of ours—a poet—fewer
Have fluttered tamer to the lure
    Than he.’ His lordship stands and racks his
Stupid brains, while one might count
    As many beads as he had boroughs,—
At length replies; from his mean front,
Like one who rubs out an account,
    Smoothing away the unmeaning furrows:
‘It happens fortunately, dear Sir,
    I can. I hope I need require
No pledge from you, that he will stir
In our affairs;—like Oliver,
    That he'll be worthy of his hire.’
These words exchanged, the news sent off
    To Peter, home the Devil hied,—
Took to his bed; he had no cough,
No doctor,—meat and drink enough,—
    Yet that same night he died.
The Devil's corpse was leaded down;
    His decent heirs enjoyed his pelf,
Mourning-coaches, many a one,
Followed his hearse along the town:—
    Where was the Devil himself?
When Peter heard of his promotion,
    His eyes grew like two stars for bliss:
There was a bow of sleek devotion
Engendering in his back; each motion
    Seemed a Lord's shoe to kiss.
He hired a house, bought plate, and made
    A genteel drive up to his door,
With sifted gravel neatly laid,—
As if defying all who said,
    Peter was ever poor.
But a disease soon struck into
    The very life and soul of Peter—
He walked about—slept—had the hue
Of health upon his cheeks—and few
    Dug better—none a heartier eater.
And yet a strange and horrid curse
    Clung upon Peter, night and day;
Month after month the thing grew worse,
And deadlier than in this my verse
    I can find strength to say.
Peter was dull—he was at first
    Dull—oh, so dull—so very dull!
Whether he talked, wrote, or rehearsed—
Still with this dulness was he cursed—
    Dull—beyond all conception—dull.
No one could read his books—no mortal,
    But a few natural friends, would hear him;
The parson came not near his portal;
His state was like that of the immortal
    Described by Swift—no man could bear him.
His sister, wife, and children yawned,
    With a long, slow, and drear ennui,
All human patience far beyond;
Their hopes of Heaven each would have pawned,
    Anywhere else to be.
But in his verse, and in his prose,
    The essence of his dulness was
Concentred and compressed so close,
'Twould have made Guatimozin doze
    On his red gridiron of brass.
A printer's boy, folding those pages,
    Fell slumbrously upon one side;
Like those famed Seven who slept three ages.
To wakeful frenzy's vigil-rages,
    As opiates, were the same applied.
Even the Reviewers who were hired
    To do the work of his reviewing,
With adamantine nerves, grew tired;—
Gaping and torpid they retired,
    To dream of what they should be doing.
And worse and worse, the drowsy curse
    Yawned in him, till it grew a pest—
A wide contagious atmosphere,
Creeping like cold through all things near;
    A power to infect and to infest.
His servant-maids and dogs grew dull;
    His kitten, late a sportive elf;
The woods and lakes, so beautiful,
Of dim stupidity were full,
    All grew dull as Peter's self.
The earth under his feet—the springs,
    Which lived within it a quick life,
The air, the winds of many wings,
That fan it with new murmurings,
    Were dead to their harmonious strife.
The birds and beasts within the wood,
    The insects, and each creeping thing,
Were now a silent multitude;
Love's work was left unwrought—no brood
    Near Peter's house took wing.
And every neighbouring cottager
    Stupidly yawned upon the other:
No jackass brayed; no little cur
Cocked up his ears;—no man would stir
    To save a dying mother.
Yet all from that charmed district went
    But some half-idiot and half-knave,
Who rather than pay any rent,
Would live with marvellous content,
    Over his father's grave.
No bailiff dared within that space,
    For fear of the dull charm, to enter;
A man would bear upon his face,
For fifteen months in any case,
    The yawn of such a venture.
Seven miles above—below—around—
    This pest of dulness holds its sway;
A ghastly life without a sound;
To Peter's soul the spell is bound—
    How should it ever pass away?



The rose that drinks the fountain dew
    In the pleasant air of noon,
Grows pale and blue with altered hue—
    In the gaze of the nightly moon;
For the planet of frost, so cold and bright,
Makes it wan with her borrowed light.
Such is my heart—roses are fair,
    And that at best a withered blossom;
But thy false care did idly wear
    Its withered leaves in a faithless bosom;
And fed with love, like air and dew,
Its growth—[....]



    My spirit like a charmèd bark doth swim
        Upon the liquid waves of thy sweet singing,
    Far far away into the regions dim
        Of rapture—as a boat, with swift sails winging
    Its way adown some many-winding river,
Speeds through dark forests o'er the waters swinging [....]



Silver key of the fountain of tears,
    Where the spirit drinks till the brain is wild;
Softest grave of a thousand fears,
    Where their mother, Care, like a drowsy child,
        Is laid asleep in flowers.



Thy country's curse is on thee, darkest crest
    Of that foul, knotted, many-headed worm
Which rends our Mother's bosom—Priestly Pest!
    Masked Resurrection of a buried Form!
Thy country's curse is on thee! Justice sold,
    Truth trampled, Nature's landmarks overthrown,
And heaps of fraud-accumulated gold,
    Plead, loud as thunder, at Destruction's throne.
And, whilst that sure slow Angel which aye stands
    Watching the beck of Mutability
Delays to execute her high commands,
    And, though a nation weeps, spares thine and thee,
Oh, let a father's curse be on thy soul,
    And let a daughter's hope be on thy tomb;
Be both, on thy gray head, a leaden cowl
    To weigh thee down to thine approaching doom!
I curse thee by a parent's outraged love,
    By hopes long cherished and too lately lost,
By gentle feelings thou couldst never prove,
    By griefs which thy stern nature never crossed;
By those infantine smiles of happy light,
    Which were a fire within a stranger's hearth,
Quenched even when kindled, in untimely night
    Hiding the promise of a lovely birth:
By those unpractised accents of young speech,
    Which he who is a father thought to frame
To gentlest lore, such as the wisest teach—
    Thou strike the lyre of mind!—oh, grief and shame!
By all the happy see in children's growth—
    That undeveloped flower of budding years—
Sweetness and sadness interwoven both,
    Source of the sweetest hopes and saddest fears—
By all the days, under an hireling's care,
    Of dull constraint and bitter heaviness,—
O wretched ye if ever any were,—
    Sadder than orphans, yet not fatherless!
By the false cant which on their innocent lips
    Must hang like poison on an opening bloom,
By the dark creeds which cover with eclipse
    Their pathway from the cradle to the tomb—
By thy most impious Hell, and all its terror;
    By all the grief, the madness, and the guilt
Of thine impostures, which must be their error—
    That sand on which thy crumbling power is built—
By thy complicity with lust and hate—
    Thy thirst for tears—thy hunger after gold—
The ready frauds which ever on thee wait—
    The servile arts in which thou hast grown old—
By thy most killing sneer, and by thy smile—
    By all the arts and snares of thy black den,
And—for thou canst outweep the crocodile—
    By thy false tears—those millstones braining men—
By all the hate which checks a father's love—
    By all the scorn which kills a father's care—
By those most impious hands which dared remove
    Nature's high bounds—by thee—and by despair—
Yes, the despair which bids a father groan,
    And cry, ‘My children are no longer mine—
The blood within those veins may be mine own,
    But—Tyrant—their polluted souls are thine;—’
I curse thee—though I hate thee not.—O slave!
    If thou couldst quench the earth-consuming Hell
Of which thou art a daemon, on thy grave
    This curse should be a blessing. Fare thee well!



Great Spirit whom the sea of boundless thought
    Nurtures within its unimagined caves,
In which thou sittest sole, as in my mind,
    Giving a voice to its mysterious waves—



The rude wind is singing
    The dirge of the music dead;
The cold worms are clinging
    Where kisses were lately fed.



Swifter far than summer's flight—
Swifter far than youth's delight—
Swifter far than happy night,
    Art thou come and gone—
As the earth when leaves are dead,
As the night when sleep is sped,
As the heart when joy is fled,
    I am left lone, alone.
The swallow summer comes again—
The owlet night resumes her reign—
But the wild-swan youth is fain
    To fly with thee, false as thou.—
My heart each day desires the morrow;
Sleep itself is turned to sorrow;
Vainly would my winter borrow
    Sunny leaves from any bough.
Lilies for a bridal bed—
Roses for a matron's head—
Violets for a maiden dead—
    Pansies let my flowers be:
On the living grave I bear
Scatter them without a tear—
Let no friend, however dear,
    Waste one hope, one fear for me.



‘Do you not hear the Aziola cry?
        Methinks she must be nigh,’
            Said Mary, as we sate
In dusk, ere stars were lit, or candles brought;
            And I, who thought
    This Aziola was some tedious woman,
        Asked, ‘Who is Aziola?’ How elate
    I felt to know that it was nothing human,
        No mockery of myself to fear or hate:
            And Mary saw my soul,
And laughed, and said, ‘Disquiet yourself not;
            'Tis nothing but a little downy owl.’
Sad Aziola! many an eventide
        Thy music I had heard
By wood and stream, meadow and mountain-side,
        And fields and marshes wide,—
Such as nor voice, nor lute, nor wind, nor bird,
        The soul ever stirred;
Unlike and far sweeter than them all.
Sad Aziola! from that moment I
        Loved thee and thy sad cry.



And who feels discord now or sorrow?
    Love is the universe to-day—
These are the slaves of dim to-morrow,
    Darkening Life's labyrinthine way.



The pale, the cold, and the moony smile
    Which the meteor beam of a starless night
Sheds on a lonely and sea-girt isle,
    Ere the dawning of morn's undoubted light,
Is the flame of life so fickle and wan
That flits round our steps till their strength is gone.
O man! hold thee on in courage of soul
    Through the stormy shades of thy worldly way,
And the billows of cloud that around thee roll
    Shall sleep in the light of a wondrous day,
Where Hell and Heaven shall leave thee free
To the universe of destiny.
This world is the nurse of all we know,
    This world is the mother of all we feel,
And the coming of death is a fearful blow
    To a brain unencompassed with nerves of steel;
When all that we know, or feel, or see,
Shall pass like an unreal mystery.
The secret things of the grave are there,
    Where all but this frame must surely be,
Though the fine-wrought eye and the wondrous ear
    No longer will live to hear or to see
All that is great and all that is strange
In the boundless realm of unending change.
Who telleth a tale of unspeaking death?
    Who lifteth the veil of what is to come?
Who painteth the shadows that are beneath
    The wide-winding caves of the peopled tomb?
Or uniteth the hopes of what shall be
With the fears and the love for that which we see?



The wind has swept from the wide atmosphere
Each vapour that obscured the sunset's ray;
And pallid Evening twines its beaming hair
In duskier braids around the languid eyes of Day:
Silence and Twilight, unbeloved of men,
Creep hand in hand from yon obscurest glen.
They breathe their spells towards the departing day,
Encompassing the earth, air, stars, and sea;
Light, sound, and motion own the potent sway,
Responding to the charm with its own mystery.
The winds are still, or the dry church-tower grass
Knows not their gentle motions as they pass.
Thou too, aëreal Pile! whose pinnacles
Point from one shrine like pyramids of fire,
Obeyest in silence their sweet solemn spells,
Clothing in hues of heaven thy dim and distant spire,
Around whose lessening and invisible height
Gather among the stars the clouds of night.
The dead are sleeping in their sepulchres:
And, mouldering as they sleep, a thrilling sound,
Half sense, half thought, among the darkness stirs,
Breathed from their wormy beds all living things around,
And mingling with the still night and mute sky
Its awful hush is felt inaudibly.
Thus solemnized and softened, death is mild
And terrorless as this serenest night:
Here could I hope, like some inquiring child
Sporting on graves, that death did hide from human sight
Sweet secrets, or beside its breathless sleep
That loveliest dreams perpetual watch did keep.



A shovel of his ashes took
From the hearth's obscurest nook,
Muttering mysteries as she went.
Helen and Henry knew that Granny
Was as much afraid of Ghosts as any,
    And so they followed hard—
But Helen clung to her brother's arm,
And her own spasm made her shake.



Ye Dorian woods and waves, lament aloud,—
Augment your tide, O streams, with fruitless tears,
For the belovèd Bion is no more.
Let every tender herb and plant and flower,
From each dejected bud and drooping bloom,
Shed dews of liquid sorrow, and with breath
Of melancholy sweetness on the wind
Diffuse its languid love; let roses blush,
Anemones grow paler for the loss
Their dells have known; and thou, O hyacinth,
Utter thy legend now—yet more, dumb flower,
Than ‘Ah! alas!’—thine is no common grief—
Bion the [sweetest singer] is no more.



The stars may dissolve, and the fountain of light
May sink into ne'er ending chaos and night,
Our mansions must fall, and earth vanish away,
But thy courage O Erin! may never decay.
See! the wide wasting ruin extends all around,
Our ancestors' dwellings lie sunk on the ground,
Our foes ride in triumph throughout our domains,
And our mightiest heroes lie stretched on the plains.
Ah! dead is the harp which was wont to give pleasure,
Ah! sunk is our sweet country's rapturous measure,
But the war note is waked, and the clangour of spears,
The dread yell of Sloghan yet sounds in our ears.
Ah! where are the heroes! triumphant in death,
Convulsed they recline on the blood sprinkled heath,
Or the yelling ghosts ride on the blast that sweeps by,
And ‘my countrymen! vengeance!’ incessantly cry.



What Mary is when she a little smiles
I cannot even tell or call to mind,
It is a miracle so new, so rare.



Now had the loophole of that dungeon, still
Which bears the name of Famine's Tower from me,
And where 'tis fit that many another will
Be doomed to linger in captivity,
Shown through its narrow opening in my cell
Moon after moon slow waning, when a sleep,
That of the future burst the veil, in dream
Visited me. It was a slumber deep
And evil; for I saw, or I did seem
To see, that tyrant Lord his revels keep,
The leader of the cruel hunt to them,
Chasing the wolf and wolf-cubs up the steep
Ascent, that from the Pisan is the screen
Of Lucca; with him Gualandi came,
Sismondi, and Lanfranchi, bloodhounds lean,
Trained to the sport and eager for the game
Wide ranging in his front; but soon were seen
Though by so short a course, with spirits tame,
The father and his whelps to flag at once,
And then the sharp fangs gored their bosoms deep.
Ere morn I roused myself, and heard my sons,
For they were with me, moaning in their sleep,
And begging bread. Ah, for those darling ones!
Right cruel art thou, if thou dost not weep
In thinking of my soul's sad augury;
And if thou weepest not now, weep never more!
They were already waked, as wont drew nigh
The allotted hour for food, and in that hour
Each drew a presage from his dream. When I
Heard locked beneath me of that horrible tower
The outlet; then into their eyes alone
I looked to read myself, without a sign
Or word. I wept not—turned within to stone.
They wept aloud, and little Anselm mine,
Said—'twas my youngest, dearest little one,—
‘What ails thee, father? Why look so at thine?’
In all that day, and all the following night,
I wept not, nor replied; but when to shine
Upon the world, not us, came forth the light
Of the new sun, and thwart my prison thrown
Gleamed through its narrow chink, a doleful sight,
Three faces, each the reflex of my own,
Were imaged by its faint and ghastly ray;
Then I, of either hand unto the bone,
Gnawed, in my agony; and thinking they
'Twas done from sudden pangs, in their excess,
All of a sudden raise themselves, and say,
‘Father! our woes, so great, where yet the less
Would you but eat of us,—'twas you who clad
Our bodies in these weeds of wretchedness;
Despoil them.’ Not to make their hearts more sad,
I hushed myself. That day is at its close,—
Another—still we were all mute. Oh, had
The obdurate earth opened to end our woes!
The fourth day dawned, and when the new sun shone,
Outstretched himself before me as it rose
My Gaddo, saying, ‘Help, father! hast thou none
For thine own child—is there no help from thee?’
He died—there at my feet—and one by one,
I saw them fall, plainly as you see me.
Between the fifth and sixth day, ere 'twas dawn,
I found myself blind-groping o'er the three.
Three days I called them after they were gone.
Famine of grief can get the mastery.



Here I sit with my paper, my pen and my ink,
First of this thing, and that thing, and t'other thing think;
Then my thoughts come so pell-mell all into my mind,
That the sense or the subject I never can find:
This word is wrong placed,—no regard to the sense,
The present and future, instead of past tense,
Then my grammar I want; O dear! what a bore,
I think I shall never attempt to write more,
With patience I then my thoughts must arraign,
Have them all in due order like mutes in a train,
Like them too must wait in due patience and thought,
Or else my fine works will all come to nought.
My wit too's so copious, it flows like a river,
But disperses its waters on black and white never;
Like smoke it appears independent and free,
But ah luckless smoke! it all passes like thee—
Then at length all my patience entirely lost,
My paper and pens in the fire are tossed;
But come, try again—you must never despair,
Our Murray's or Entick's are not all so rare,
Implore their assistance—they'll come to your aid,
Perform all your business without being paid,
They'll tell you the present tense, future and past,
Which should come first, and which should come last,
This Murray will do—then to Entick repair,
To find out the meaning of any word rare.
This they friendly will tell, and ne'er make you blush,
With a jeering look, taunt, or an O fie! tush!
Then straight all your thoughts in black and white put,
Not minding the if's, the be's, and the but,
Then read it all over, see how it will run,
How answers the wit, the retort, and the pun,
Your writings may then with old Socrates vie,
May on the same shelf with Demosthenes lie,
May as Junius be sharp, or as Plato be sage,
The pattern or satire to all of the age;
But stop—a mad author I mean not to turn,
Nor with thirst of applause does my heated brain burn,
Sufficient that sense, wit, and grammar combined,
My letters may make some slight food for the mind;
That my thoughts to my friends I may freely impart,
In all the warm language that flows from the heart,
Hark! futurity calls! it loudly complains,
It bids me step forward and just hold the reins,
My excuse shall be humble, and faithful, and true,
Such as I fear can be made but by few—
Of writers this age has abundance and plenty,
Three score and a thousand, two millions and twenty,
Three score of them wits who all sharply vie,
To try what odd creature they best can belie,
A thousand are prudes who for Charity write,
And fill up their sheets with spleen, envy, and spite[,]
One million are bards, who to Heaven aspire,
And stuff their works full of bombast, rant, and fire,
T'other million are wags who in Grubstreet attend,
And just like a cobbler the old writings mend,
The twenty are those who for pulpits indite,
And pore over sermons all Saturday night.
And now my good friends—who come after I mean,
As I ne'er wore a cassock, or dined with a dean,
Or like cobblers at mending I never did try,
Nor with poets in lyrics attempted to vie;
As for prudes these good souls I both hate and detest,
So here I believe the matter must rest.—
I've heard your complaint—my answer I've made,
And since to your calls all the tribute I've paid,
Adieu my good friend; pray never despair,
But grammar and sense and everything dare,
Attempt but to write dashing, easy, and free,
Then take out your grammar and pay him his fee,
Be not a coward, shrink not to a tense,
But read it all over and make it out sense.
What a tiresome girl!—pray soon make an end,
Else my limited patience you'll quickly expend.
Well adieu, I no longer your patience will try—
So swift to the post now the letter shall fly.



For your letter, dear  [Hattie], accept my best thanks,
Rendered long and amusing by virtue of franks,
Though concise they would please, yet the longer the better,
The more news that's crammed in, more amusing the letter,
All excuses of etiquette nonsense I hate,
Which only are fit for the tardy and late,
As when converse grows flat, of the weather they talk,
How fair the sun shines—a fine day for a walk,
Then to politics turn, of Burdett's reformation,
One declares it would hurt, t'other better the nation,
Will ministers keep? sure they've acted quite wrong,
The burden this is of each morning call song.
So  is going to  you say,
I hope that success her great efforts will pay
That [the Colonel] will see her, be dazzled outright,
And declare he can't bear to be out of her sight.
Write flaming epistles with love's pointed dart,
Whose sharp little arrow struck right on his heart,
Scold poor innocent Cupid for mischievous ways,
He knows not how much to laud forth her praise,
That he neither eats, drinks or sleeps for her sake,
And hopes her hard heart some compassion will take,
A refusal would kill him, so desperate his flame,
But he fears, for he knows she is not common game,
Then praises her sense, wit, discernment and grace,
He's not one that's caught by a sly looking face,
Yet that's too divine—such a black sparkling eye,
At the bare glance of which near a thousand will die;
Thus runs he on meaning but one word in ten,
More than is meant by most such kind of men,
For they're all alike, take them one with another,
Begging pardon—with the exception of my brother.
Of the drawings you mention much praise I have heard,
Most opinion's the same, with the difference of word,
Some get a good name by the voice of the crowd,
Whilst to poor humble merit small praise is allowed,
As in parliament votes, so in pictures a name,
Oft determines a fate at the altar of fame.—
So on Friday this City's gay vortex you quit,
And no longer with Doctors and Johnny cats sit—
Now your parcel's arrived  [Bysshe's] letter shall go,
I hope all your joy mayn't be turned into woe,
Experience will tell you that pleasure is vain,
When it promises sunshine how often comes rain.
So when to fond hope every blessing is nigh,
How oft when we smile it is checked with a sigh,
When Hope, gay deceiver, in pleasure is dressed,
How oft comes a stroke that may rob us of rest.
When we think ourselves safe, and the goal near at hand,
Like a vessel just landing, we're wrecked near the strand,
And though memory forever the sharp pang must feel,
'Tis our duty to bear, and our hardship to steel—
May misfortunes dear Girl, ne'er thy happiness cloy,
May thy days glide in peace, love, comfort and joy,
May thy tears with soft pity for other woes flow,
Woes, which thy tender heart never may know,
For hardships our own, God has taught us to bear,
Though sympathy's soul to a friend drops a tear.
Oh dear! what sentimental stuff have I written,
Only fit to tear up and play with a kitten.
What sober reflections in the midst of this letter!
Jocularity sure would have suited much better;
But there are exceptions to all common rules,
For this is a truth by all boys learned at schools.
Now adieu my dear  [Hattie] I'm sure I must tire,
For if I do, you may throw it into the fire,
So accept the best love of your cousin and friend,
Which brings this nonsensical rhyme to an end.



Ask not the pallid stranger's woe,
    With beating heart and throbbing breast,
Whose step is faltering, weak, and slow,
    As though the body needed rest.—
Whose 'wildered eye no object meets,
    Nor cares to ken a friendly glance,
With silent grief his bosom beats,—
    Now fixed, as in a deathlike trance.
Who looks around with fearful eye,
    And shuns all converse with mankind,
As though some one his griefs might spy,
    And soothe them with a kindred mind.
A friend or foe to him the same,
    He looks on each with equal eye;
The difference lies but in the name,
    To none for comfort can he fly.—
'Twas deep despair, and sorrow's trace,
    To him too keenly given,
Whose memory, time could not efface—
    His peace was lodged in Heaven.—
He looks on all this world bestows,
    The pride and pomp of power,
As trifles best for pageant shows
    Which vanish in an hour.
When torn is dear affection's tie,
    Sinks the soft heart full low;
It leaves without a parting sigh,
    All that these realms bestow.



The brilliant orb of parting day
Diffused a rich and mellow ray,
Above the mountain's brow;
It tinged the hills with lustrous light,
It tinged the promontory's height,
Still sparkling with the snow;
And as aslant it threw its beam,
Tipt with gold the mountain stream
That laved the vale below;
Long hung the eye of glory there,
And linger'd as if loth to leave
A scene so lovely and so fair.
'Twere luxury even, there to grieve.
So soft the clime, so balm the air,
So pure and genial were the skies,
In sooth 'twas almost Paradise,—
For ne'er did the sun's splendour close
On such a picture of repose;—
All, all was tranquil, all was still,
Save when the music of the rill,
Or distant waterfall,
At intervals broke on the ear
Which echo's self was charmed to hear,
And ceased her babbling call.
With every charm the landscape glow'd
Which partial Nature's hand bestow'd;
Nor could the mimic hand of art
Such beauties or such hues impart.
Light clouds in fleeting livery gay,
Hung, painted in grotesque array
Upon the western sky:
Forgetful of the approaching dawn,
The peasants danced upon the lawn,
For the vintage time was nigh:
How jocund to the tabor's sound,
O'er the smooth, trembling turf they bound,
In every measure light and free,
The very soul of harmony;
Grace in each attitude, they move,
They thrill to amorous ecstasy,
Light as the dewdrops of the morn,
That hang upon the blossomed thorn,
Subdued by the pow'r of resistless Love.
Ah! days of innocence, of joy,
Of rapture that knows no alloy,
Haste on,—ye roseate hours,
Free from the world's tumultuous cares,
From pale distrust, from hopes and fears,
Baneful concomitants of time,—
'Tis yours, beneath this favour'd clime,
Your pathway strewn with flowers,
Upborne on pleasure's downy wing,
To quaff a long unfading spring,
And beat with light and careless step the ground;
The fairest flowers too soon grow sere,
Too soon shall tempests blast the year,
And sin's eternal winter reign around.
But see, what forms are those,
Scarce seen by glimpse of dim twilight,
Wandering o'er the mountain's height?
They swiftly haste to the vale below:
One wraps his mantle around his brow,
As if to hide his woes;
And as his steed impetuous flies,
What strange fire flashes from his eyes!
The far off city's murmuring sound
Was borne on the breeze which floated around;
Noble Padua's lofty spire
Scarce glow'd with the sunbeam's latest fire,
Yet dashed the travellers on—
Ere night o'er the earth was spread,
Full many a mile they must have sped,
Ere their destined course was run.
Welcome was the moonbeam's ray,
Which slept upon the towers so grey.
But, hark! a convent's vesper bell—
It seemed to be a very spell—
The stranger checked his courser's rein,
And listened to the mournful sound:
Listened—and paused—and paused again:
A thrill of pity and of pain
Through his inmost soul had past,
While gushed the tear-drops silently and fast.
A crowd was at the convent gate,
The gate was opened wide;
No longer on his steed he sate,
But mingled with the tide.
He felt a solemn awe and dread,
As he the chapel entered;
Dim was the light from the pale moon beaming,
As it fell on the saint-cyphered panes;
Or from the western window streaming,
Tinged the pillars with varied stains.
To the eye of enthusiasm strange forms were gliding
In each dusky recess of the aisle;
And indefined shades in succession were striding,
O'er the coignes of the gothic pile.
The pillars to the vaulted roof
In airy lightness rose;
Now they mount to the rich Gothic ceiling aloof,
And exquisite tracery disclose.
The altar illumined now darts its bright rays,
The train past in brilliant array;
On the shrine Saint Pietro's rich ornaments blaze,
And rival the brilliance of day
Hark!—now the loud organ swells full on the ear—
So sweetly mellow, chaste, and clear;
Melting, kindling, raising, firing,
Delighting now, and now inspiring,
Peal upon peal the music floats—
Now they list still as death to the dying notes;
Whilst the soft voices of the choir,
Exalt the soul from base desire;
Till it mounts on unearthly pinions free,
Dissolved in heavenly ecstasy.
Now a dead stillness reigned around,
Uninterrupted by a sound;
Save when in deadened response ran,
The last faint echoes down the aisle,
Reverberated through the pile,
As within the pale the holy man,
With voice devout and saintly look,
Slow chaunted from the sacred book,
Or pious prayers were duly said,
For spirits of departed dead.
With beads and crucifix and hood,
Close by his side the abbess stood;
Now her dark penetrating eyes
Were raised in suppliance to heaven,
And now her bosom heaved with sighs,
As if to human weakness given.
Her stern, severe, yet beauteous brow
Frowned on all who stood below;
And the fire which flashed from her steady gaze,
As it turned on the listening crowd its rays,
Superior virtue told,—
Virtue as pure as heaven's own dew,
But which, untainted, never knew,
To pardon weaker mould.
The heart though chaste and cold as snow—
'Twere faulty to be virtuous so.
Not a whisper now breathed in the pillared aisle—
The stranger advanced to the altar high—
Convulsive was heard a smothered sigh!
Lo! four fair nuns to the altar draw near,
With solemn footstep, as the while
A fainting novice they bear—
The roses from her cheek are fled
But there the lily reigns instead;
Light as a sylph's, her form confest,
Beneath the drapery of her vest,
A perfect grace and symmetry;
Her eyes, with rapture form'd to move,
To melt with tenderness and love,
Or beam with sensibility,
To Heaven were raised in pious prayer,
A silent eloquence of woe;
Now hung the pearly tear-drop there,
Sate on her cheek a fix'd despair;
And now she beat her bosom bare,
As pure as driven snow.
Nine graceful novices around
Fresh roses strew upon the ground:
In purest white arrayed,
Nine spotless vestal virgins shed
Sabæan incense o'er the head
Of the devoted maid.
They dragged her to the altar's pale,
The traveller leant against the rail,
And gazed with eager eye,—
His cheek was flushed with sudden glow,
On his brow sate a darker shade of woe,
As a transient expression fled by.
The sympathetic feeling flew
Thro' every breast, from man to man,
Confused and open clamours ran,
Louder and louder still they grew;
When the abbess waved her hand,
A stern resolve was in her eye,
And every wild tumultuous cry
Was stilled at her command.
The abbess made the well known sign—
The novice reached the fatal shrine,
And mercy implored from the power divine;
At length she shrieked aloud,
She dashed from the supporting nun,
Ere the fatal rite was done,
And plunged amid the crowd.
Confusion reigned throughout the throng,
Still the novice fled along,
Impelled by frantic fear,
When the maddened traveller's eager grasp
In firmest yet in wildest clasp
Arrested her career.
As fainting from terror she sank on the ground,
Her loosened locks floated her fine form around;
The zone which confined her shadowy vest
No longer her throbbing bosom prest,
Its animation dead;
No more her feverish pulse beat high,
Expression dwelt not in her eye,
Her wildered senses fled.
[....]
Hark! Hark! the demon of the storm!
I see his vast expanding form
Blend with the strange and sulphurous glare
Of comets through the turbid air.
Yes, 'twas his voice, I heard its roar,
The wild waves lashed the caverned shore
In angry murmurs hoarse and loud,
Higher and higher still they rise;
Red lightnings gleam from every cloud
And paint wild shapes upon the skies;
The echoing thunder rolls around,
Convulsed with earthquake rocks the ground.
The traveller yet undaunted stood,
He heeded not the roaring flood;
Yet Rosa slept, her bosom bare,
Her cheek was deadly pale,
The ringlets of her auburn hair
Streamed in a lengthened trail,
And motionless her seraph form;
Unheard, unheeded raved the storm.
Whilst, borne on the wing of the gale,
The harrowing shriek of the white sea-mew
As o'er the midnight surge she flew;
The howlings of the squally blast
As o'er the beetling cliffs it past;
Mingled with the peals on high,
That, swelling louder, echoed by,
Assailed the traveller's ear.
He heeded not the maddened storm
As it pelted against his lofty form,
He felt no awe, no fear.
In contrast, like the courser pale 

That stalks along Death's pitchy vale
With silent, with gigantic tread,
Trampling the dying and the dead.
Rising from her death-like trance,
Fair Rosa met the stranger's glance;
She started from his chilling gaze,
Wild was it as the tempest's blaze,
It shot a lurid gleam of light.
A secret spell of sudden dread,
A mystic, strange, and harrowing fear,
As when the spirits of the dead,
Drest in ideal shapes appear,
And hideous glance on human sight—
Scarce could Rosa's frame sustain,
The chill that pressed upon her brain.
Anon, that transient spell was o'er,
Dark clouds deform his brow no more,
But rapid fled away;
Sweet fascination dwelt around,
Mixed with a soft, a silver sound,
As soothing to the ravished ear,
As what enthusiast lovers hear;
Which seems to steal along the sky,
When mountain mists are seen to fly,
Before the approach of day.
He seized on wondering Rosa's hand,
“And, ah!” cried he, “be this the band
Shall join us, till this earthly frame,
Sinks convulsed in bickering flame—
When around the demons yell,
And drag the sinful wretch to hell,
Then, Rosa, will we part—
Then fate, and only fate's decree,
Shall tear thy lovely soul from me,
And rend thee from my heart.
Long has Paulo sought in vain,
A friend to share his grief,—
Never will he seek again,
For the wretch has found relief,
Till the Prince of Darkness bursts his chain,
Till death and desolation reign—
Rosa, wilt thou then be mine?
Ever fairest, I am thine!”
He ceased, and on the howling blast,
Which wildly round the mountain past,
Died his accents low;
Yet fiercely howled the midnight storm,
As Paulo bent his awful form,
And leaned his lofty brow.
“Stranger, mystic stranger, rise;
Whence do these tumults fill the skies?
Who conveyed me, say, this night,
To this wild and cloud-capped height?
Who art thou? and why am I
Beneath Heaven's pityless canopy?
For the wild winds roar around my head;
Lightnings redden the wave;—
Was it the power of the mighty dead,
Who live beneath the grave?
Or did the Abbess drag me here,
To make yon swelling surge my bier?”
“Ah, lovely Rosa! cease thy fear,
It was thy friend who bore thee here—
I, thy friend, till this fabric of earth,
Sinks in the chaos that gave it birth;
Till the meteor-bolt of the God above,
Shall tear its victim from his love,—
That love which must unbroken last,
Till the hour of envious fate is past;
Till the mighty basements of the sky
In bickering hell-flames heated fly:
E'en then will I sit on some rocky height,
Whilst around lower clouds of eternal night,
E'en then will I loved Rosa save
From the yawning abyss of the grave.—
Or, into the gulf impetuous hurled—
If sinks with its latest tenants the world,
Then will our souls in union fly
Throughout the wide and boundless sky:
Then, free from th'ills that envious fate
Has heaped upon our mortal state,
We'll taste etherial pleasure;
Such as none but thou canst give,—
Such as none but I receive,
And rapture without measure.”
As thus he spoke, a sudden blaze
Of pleasure mingled in his gaze:
Illumined by the dazzling light,
He glows with radiant lustre bright;
His features with new glory shine,
And sparkle as with beams divine.
“Strange, awful being,” Rosa said,
“Whence is this superhuman dread,
That harrows up my inmost frame?
Whence does this unknown tingling flame,
Consume and penetrate my soul?
By turns with fear and love possessed,
Tumultuous thoughts swell high my breast;
A thousand wild emotions roll,
And mingle their resistless tide;
O'er thee some magic arts preside;
As by the influence of a charm
Lulled into rest my griefs subside,
And safe in thy protecting arm,
I feel no power can do me harm:
But the storm raves wildly o'er the sea,
Bear me away! I confide in thee!”
“Ah, lovely Rosa! cease thy fear,

The horrors of the mighty blast,
The lowering tempest clouds were past,
Had sunk beneath the main;
Light baseless mists were all that fled,
Above the weary traveller's head,
As he left the spacious plain.
Fled were the vapours of the night,
Faint streaks of rosy tinted light
Were painted on the matin grey;
And as the sun began to rise,
To pour his animating ray,
Glowed with his fire the eastern skies,
The distant rocks—the far-off bay,
The ocean's sweet and lovely blue,
The mountain's variegated breast,
Blushing with tender tints of dawn,
Or with fantastic shadows drest.
The waving wood, the opening lawn,
Rose to existence, waked anew,
In colours exquisite of hue,
Their mingled charms Victorio viewed,
And lost in admiration stood.
From yesternight how changed the scene,
When howled the blast o'er the dark cliffs' side,
And mingled with the maddened roar
Of the wild surge that lashed the shore.
To-day—scarce heard the whispering breeze,
And still and motionless the seas
Scarce heard the murmuring of their tide;
All, all is peaceful and serene,
Serenely on Victorio's breast
It breathed a soft and tranquil rest,
Which bade each wild emotion cease,
And hushed the passions into peace.
Along the winding Po he went,
His footsteps to the spot were bent
Where Paulo dwelt, his wandered friend,
For thither did his wishes tend.
Noble Victorio's race was proud,
From Cosmo's blood he came;
To him a wild untutored crowd
Of vassals, in allegiance bowed,
Illustrious was his name;
Yet vassals and wealth he scorned, to go
Unnoticed with a man of woe:
Gay hope and expectation sate,
Throned in his eager eye,
And ere he reached the castle gate,
The sun had mounted high.
Wild was the spot where the castle stood,
Its towers embosomed deep in wood,
Gigantic cliffs, with craggy steeps,
Reared their proud heads on high,
Their bases were washed by the foaming deeps,
Their summits were hid in the sky;
From the valley below they excluded the day,
That valley ne'er cheered by the sunbeam's ray;
Nought broke on the silence drear,
Save the hungry vultures darting by,
Or eagles yelling fearfully,
As they bore to the rocks their prey,
Or when the fell wolf ravening prowled,
Or the gaunt wild boar fiercely howled
His hideous screams on the night's dull ear.
Borne on pleasure's downy wing,
Downy as the breath of spring,
Not thus fled Paulo's hours away,
Though brightened by the cheerful day:
Friendship or wine, or softer love,
The sparkling eye, the foaming bowl,
Could with no lasting rapture move,
Nor still the tumults of his soul.
And yet there was in Rosa's kiss
A momentary thrill of bliss;
Oft the dark clouds of grief would fly,
Beneath the beams of sympathy;
And love and converse sweet bestow,
A transient requiem from woe.—
Strange business, and of import vast,
On things which long ago were past,
Drew Paulo oft from home;
Then would a darker, deeper shade,
By sorrow traced, his brow o'erspread
And o'er his features roam.
Oft as they spent the midnight hour,
And heard the wintry wild winds rave
Midst the roar and spray of the dashing wave,
Was Paulo's dark brow seen to lour.
Then, as the lamp's uncertain blaze
Shed o'er the hall its partial rays,
And shadows strange were seen to fall,
And glide upon the dusky wall,
Would Paulo start with sudden fear.
Why then unbidden gush'd the tear,
As he mutter'd strange words to the ear?—
Why frequent heaved the smother'd sigh?—
Why did he gaze on vacancy,
As if some strange form was near?
Then would the fillet of his brow
Fierce as a fiery furnace glow,
As it burn'd with red and lambent flame,
Then would cold shuddering seize his frame,
As gasping he labour'd for breath.
The strange light of his gorgon eye,
As, frenzied and rolling dreadfully,
It glared with terrific gleam,
Would chill like the spectre gaze of death,
As, conjured by feverish dream,
He seems o'er the sick man's couch to stand,
And shakes the dread lance in his skeleton hand.
But when the paroxysm was o'er,
And clouds deform'd his brow no more,
Would Rosa soothe his tumults dire,
Would bid him calm his grief,
Would quench reflection's rising fire,
And give his soul relief.
As on his form with pitying eye,
The ministering angel hung,
And wiped the drops of agony,
The music of her syren tongue
Lull'd forcibly his griefs to rest,
Like fleeting visions of the dead,
Or midnight dreams, his sorrows fled:
Waked to new life through all his soul
A soft delicious languor stole,
And lapt in heavenly ecstasy
He sank and fainted on her breast.
'Twas on an eve, the leaf was sere,
Howl'd the blast round the castle drear,
The boding night-bird's hideous cry
Was mingled with the warning sky;
Heard was the distant torrent's dash,
Seen was the lightning's dark red flash.
As it gleamed on the stormy cloud;
Heard was the troubled ocean's roar,
As its wild waves lash'd the rocky shore;
The thunder mutter'd loud,
As wilder still the lightnings flew;
Wilder as the tempest blew,
More wildly strange their converse grew.
They talk'd of the ghosts of the mighty dead,
If, when the spark of life were fled,
They visited this world of woe?
Or, were it but a phantasy,
Deceptive to the feverish eye,
When strange forms flashed upon the sight,
And stalk'd along at the dead of night?
Or if, in the realms above,
They still, for mortals left below,
Retain'd the same affection's glow,
In friendship or in love?—
Debating thus, a pensive train,
Thought upon thought began to rise;
Her thrilling wild harp Rosa took;
What sounds in softest murmurs broke
From the seraphic strings!
Celestials borne on odorous wings,
Caught the dulcet melodies,
The life-blood ebb'd in every vein,
As Paulo listen'd to the strain.
“What sounds are those that float upon the air,
As if to bid the fading day farewell,—
What form is that so shadowy, yet so fair,
Which glides along the rough and pathless dell?
Nightly those sounds swell full upon the breeze,
Which seems to sigh as if in sympathy;
They hang amid yon cliff-embosom'd trees,
Or float in dying cadence through the sky.
Now rests that form upon the moonbeam pale,
In piteous strains of woe its vesper sings;
Now—now it traverses the silent vale,
Borne on transparent ether's viewless wings.
Oft will it rest beside yon abbey's tower,
Which lifts its ivy-mantled mass so high;
Rears its dark head to meet the storms that lour,
And braves the trackless tempests of the sky.
That form, the embodied spirit of a maid,
Forced by a perjured lover to the grave;
A desperate fate the madden'd girl obey'd,
And from the dark cliffs plung'd into the wave.
There the deep murmurs of the restless surge,
The mournful shriekings of the white sea-mew,
The warring waves, the wild winds, sang her dirge,
And o'er her bones the dark red coral grew.
Yet though that form be sunk beneath the main,
Still rests her spirit where its vows were given;
Still fondly visits each loved spot again,
And pours its sorrows on the ear of Heaven.
That spectre wanders through the abbey dale,
And suffers pangs which such a fate must share;
Early her soul sank in death's darken'd vale,
And ere long all of us must meet her there.”

She ceased, and on the listening ear
Her pensive accents died;
So sad they were, so softly clear,
It seemed as if some angel's sigh
Had breathed the plaintive symphony;
So ravishingly sweet their close,
The tones awakened Paulo's woes;
Oppressive recollections rose,
And poured their bitter tide.
Absorbed awhile in grief he stood;
At length he seemed as one inspired,
His burning fillet blazed with blood—
A lambent flame his features fired.
“The hour is come, the fated hour;
Whence is this new, this unfelt power?—
Yes, I've a secret to unfold,
And such a tale as ne'er was told,
A dreadful, dreadful mystery!
Scenes, at whose retrospect e'en now,
Cold drops of anguish on my brow,
The icy chill of death I feel:
Wrap, Rosa, bride, thy breast in steel,
Thy soul with nerves of iron brace,
As to your eyes I darkly trace,
My sad, my cruel destiny.
“Victorio, lend your ears, arise,
Let us seek the battling skies,
Wild o'er our heads the thunder crashing,
And at our feet the wild waves dashing;
As tempest, clouds, and billows roll,
In gloomy concert with my soul.
Rosa, follow me—
For my soul is joined to thine,
And thy being's linked to mine—
Rosa, list to me.”
“'Tis sixteen hundred years ago,
Since I came from Israel's land;
Sixteen hundred years of woe!—
With deep and furrowing hand,
God's mark is painted on my head;
Must there remain until the dead
Hear the last trump, and leave the tomb,
And earth spouts fire from her riven womb.
“How can I paint that dreadful day,
That time of terror and dismay,
When, for our sins, a Saviour died,
And the meek Lamb was crucified!
As dread that day, when borne along
To slaughter by the insulting throng,
Infuriate for Deicide,
I mocked our Saviour, and I cried,
Go, go, ‘Ah! I will go,’ said he,
‘Where scenes of endless bliss invite;
To the blest regions of the light
I go, but thou shalt here remain—
Thou diest not till I come again’—
E'en now, by horror traced, I see
His perforated feet and hands;
The madden'd crowd around him stands.
Pierces his side the ruffian spear,
Big rolls the bitter anguish'd tear.
Hark, that deep groan!—he dies—he dies.
And breathes, in death's last agonies,
Forgiveness to his enemies.
Then was the noon-day glory clouded,
The sun in pitchy darkness shrouded.
Then were strange forms through the darkness gleaming,
And the red orb of night on Jerusalem beaming;
Which faintly, with ensanguined light,
Dispersed the thickening shades of night.
Convulsed, all nature shook with fear,
As if the very end was near;
Earth to her centre trembled;
Rent in twain was the temple's vail,
The graves gave up their dead;
Whilst ghosts and spirits, ghastly pale,
Glared hideous on the sight,
Seen through the dark and lurid air,
As fiends array'd in light,
Threw on the scene a frightful glare,
And, howling, shriek'd with hideous yell—
They shriek'd in joy, for a Saviour fell!
'Twas then I felt the Almighty's ire;
Then full on my remembrance came
Those words despised alas! too late!
The horrors of my endless fate
Flashed on my soul and shook my frame;
They scorch'd my breast as with a flame
Of unextinguishable fire;
An exquisitely torturing pain
Of frenzying anguish fired my brain.
By keen remorse and anguish driven,
I called for vengeance down from Heaven.
But, ah! the all-wasting hand of Time,
Might never wear away my crime!
I scarce could draw my fluttering breath—
Was it the appalling grasp of death?
I lay entranced, and deemed he shed
His dews of poppy o'er my head;
But though the kindly warmth was dead,
The self-inflicted torturing pangs
Of conscience lent their scorpion fangs,
Still life prolonging, after life was fled.
“Methought, what glories met my sight,
As burst a sudden blaze of light,
Illumining the azure skies,
I saw the blessed Saviour rise.
But how unlike to him who bled!
Where then his thorn-encircled head?
Where the big drops of agony
Which dimmed the lustre of his eye?
Or deathlike hue that overspread
The features of that heavenly face?
Gone now was every mortal trace;
His eyes with radiant lustre beamed—
His form confessed celestial grace,
And with a blaze of glory streamed.
Innumerable hosts around,
Their brows with wreaths immortal crowned,
With amaranthine chaplets bound,
As on their wings the cross they bore,
Deep dyed in the Redeemer's gore,
Attune their golden harps, and sing
Loud hallelujahs to their King.
“But, in an instant, from my sight,
Fled were the visions of delight.
Darkness had spread her raven pall;
Dank, lurid darkness cover'd all.
All was as silent as the dead;
I felt a petrifying dread,
Which harrowed up my frame;
When suddenly a lurid stream
Of dark red light, with hideous gleam,
Shot like a meteor through the night,
And painted Hell upon the skies—
The Hell from whence it came.
What clouds of sulphur seemed to rise!
What sounds were borne upon the air!
The breathings of intense despair—
The piteous shrieks—the wails of woe—
The screams of torment and of pain—
The red-hot rack—the clanking chain!
I gazed upon the gulf below,
Till, fainting from excess of fear,
My tottering knees refused to bear
My odious weight. I sink—I sink!
Already had I reached the brink.
The fiery waves disparted wide,
To plunge me in their sulphurous tide;
When, racked by agonizing pain,
I started into life again.
“Yet still the impression left behind
Was deeply graven on my mind,
In characters whose inward trace
No change or time could e'er deface;
A burning cross illumed my brow,
I hid it with a fillet grey,
But could not hide the wasting woe
That wore my wildered soul away,
And ate my heart with living fire.
I knew it was the avenger's sway,
I felt it was the avenger's ire!
“A burden on the face of earth,
I cursed the mother who gave me birth;
I cursed myself—my native land.
Polluted by repeated crimes,
I sought in distant foreign climes
If change of country could bestow
A transient respite from my woe.
Vain from myself the attempt to fly,
Sole cause of my own misery.
“Since when, in death-like trance I lay,
Past, slowly past, the years away
That poured a bitter stream on me,
When once I fondly longed to see
Jerusalem, alas! my native place,
Jerusalem, alas! no more in name,
No portion of her former fame
Had left behind a single trace.
Her pomp, her splendour, was no more.
Her towers no longer seem to rise,
To lift their proud heads to the skies.
Fane and monumental bust,
Long levelled even with the dust.
The holy pavements were stained with gore.
The place where the sacred temple stood
Was crimson-dyed with Jewish blood.
Long since, my parents had been dead,
All my posterity had bled
Beneath the dark Crusader's spear,
No friend was left my path to cheer,
To shed a few last setting rays
Of sunshine on my evening days!
“Rack'd by the tortures of the mind,
How have I long'd to plunge beneath
The mansions of repelling death!
And strove that resting place to find
Where earthly sorrows cease.
Oft, when the tempest-fiends engaged,
And the warring winds tumultuous raged,
Confounding skies with seas,
Then would I rush to the towering height
Of the gigantic Teneriffe,
Or some precipitous cliff,
All in the dead of the silent night.
“I have cast myself from the mountain's height,
Above was day—below was night;
The substantial clouds that lower'd beneath
Bore my detested form;
They whirl'd it above the volcanic breath,
And the meteors of the storm;
The torrents of electric flame
Scorch'd to a cinder my fated frame.
Hark to the thunder's awful crash—
Hark to the midnight lightning's hiss!
At length was heard a sullen dash,
Which made the hollow rocks around
Rebellow to the awful sound;
The yawning ocean opening wide,
Received me in its vast abyss,
And whelm'd me in its foaming tide.
Though my astounded senses fled,
Yet did the spark of life remain;
Then the wild surges of the main
Dash'd and left me on the rocky shore.
Oh! would that I had waked no more!
Vain wish! I lived again to feel
Torments more fierce than those of hell!
A tide of keener pain to roll,
And the bruises to enter my inmost soul!
“I cast myself in Etna's womb,
If haply I might meet my doom,
In torrents of electric flame;
Thrice happy had I found a grave
'Mid fierce combustion's tumults dire,
'Mid oceans of volcanic fire
Which whirl'd me in their sulphurous wave,
And scorched to a cinder my hated frame,
Parch'd up the blood within my veins,
And rack'd my breast with damning pains;
Then hurl'd me from the mountain's entrails dread.
With what unutterable woe
Even now I feel this bosom glow—
I burn—I melt with fervent heat—
Again life's pulses wildly beat—
What endless throbbing pains I live to feel!
The elements respect their Maker's seal,—
That seal deep printed on my fated head.
“Still like the scathed pine-tree's height,
Braving the tempests of the night
Have I 'scaped the bickering fire.
Like the scathed pine which a monument stands
Of faded grandeur, which the brands
Of the tempest-shaken air
Have riven on the desolate heath,
Yet it stands majestic even in death,
And rears its wild form there.
Thus have I 'scaped the ocean's roar
The red-hot bolt from God's right hand,
The flaming midnight meteor brand,
And Etna's flames of bickering fire.
Thus am I doom'd by fate to stand,
A monument of the Eternal's ire;
Nor can this being pass away,
Till time shall be no more.
“I pierce with intellectual eye,
Into each hidden mystery;
I penetrate the fertile womb
Of nature; I produce to light
The secrets of the teeming earth,
And give air's unseen embryos birth:
The past, the present, and to come,
Float in review before my sight:
To me is known the magic spell,
To summon e'en the Prince of Hell;
Awed by the Cross upon my head,
His fiends would obey my mandates dread,
To twilight change the blaze of noon,
And stain with spots of blood the moon—
But that an interposing hand
Restrains my potent arts, my else supreme command.”
He raised his passion-quivering hand,
He loosed the grey encircling band,
A burning Cross was there;
Its colour was like to recent blood,
Deep marked upon his brow it stood,
And spread a lambent glare.
Dimmer grew the taper's blaze,
Dazzled by the brighter rays,
Whilst Paulo spoke—'twas dead of night—
Fair Rosa shuddered with affright;
Victorio, fearless, had braved death
Upon the blood-besprinkled heath;
Had heard, unmoved, the cannon's roar,
Echoing along the Wolga's shore.
When the thunder of battle was swelling,
When the birds for their dead prey were yelling,
When the ensigns of slaughter were streaming,
And falchions and bayonets were gleaming,
And almost felt death's chilling hand,
Stretched on ensanguined Wolga's strand,
And, careless, scorned for life to cry,
Yet now he turned aside his eye,
Scarce could his death-like terror bear,
And owned now what it was to fear.
“Once a funeral met my aching sight,
It blasted my eyes at the dead of night,
When the sightless fiends of the tempests rave,
And hell-birds howl o'er the storm-blacken'd wave.
Nought was seen, save at fits, but the meteor's glare
And the lightnings of God painting hell on the air;
Nought was heard save the thunder's wild voice in the sky,
And strange birds who, shrieking, fled dismally by.
'Twas then from my head my drench'd hair that I tore,
And bade my vain dagger's point drink my life's gore;
'Twas then I fell on the ensanguined earth,
And cursed the mother who gave me birth!
My maddened brain could bear no more—
Hark! the chilling whirlwind's roar;
The spirits of the tombless dead
Flit around my fated head,—
Howl horror and destruction round,
As they quaff my blood that stains the ground,
And shriek amid their deadly stave,—
‘Never shalt thou find the grave!
Ever shall thy fated soul
In life's protracted torments roll,
Till, in latest ruin hurl'd,
And fate's destruction, sinks the world!
Till the dead arise from the yawning ground,
To meet their Maker's last decree,
Till angels of vengeance flit around,
And loud yelling demons seize on thee!’
“Ah! would were come that fated hour,
When the clouds of chaos around shall lower;
When this globe calcined by the fury of God
Shall sink beneath his wrathful nod!”
As thus he spake, a wilder gaze
Of fiend-like horror lit his eye
With a most unearthly blaze,
As if some phantom-form passed by.
At last he stilled the maddening wail
Of grief, and thus pursued his tale:—
“Oft I invoke the fiends of hell,
And summon each in dire array—
I know they dare not disobey
My stern, my powerful spell.
—Once on a night, when not a breeze
Ruffled the surface of the seas,
The elements were lulled to rest,
And all was calm save my sad breast,
On death resolved—intent,
I marked a circle round my form;
About me sacred reliques spread,
The reliques of magicians dead,
And potent incantations read—
I waited their event.
“All at once grew dark the night,
Mists of swarthiness hung o'er the pale moonlight.
Strange yells were heard, the boding cry
Of the night raven that flitted by,
Whilst the silver winged mew
Startled with screams o'er the dark wave flew.
'Twas then I seized a magic wand,
The wand by an enchanter given,
And deep dyed in his heart's red blood.
The crashing thunder pealed aloud;
I saw the portentous meteor's glare
And the lightnings gleam o'er the lurid air;
I raised the wand in my trembling hand,
And pointed Hell's mark at the zenith of Heaven.
“A superhuman sound
Broke faintly on the listening ear,
Like to a silver harp the notes,
And yet they were more soft and clear.
I wildly strained my eyes around—
Again the unknown music floats.
Still stood Hell's mark above my head—
In wildest accents I summoned the dead—
And through the unsubstantial night,
It diffused a strange and fiendish light;
Spread its rays to the charnel-house air,
And marked mystic forms on the dark vapours there.
The winds had ceased—a thick dark smoke
From beneath the pavement broke;
Around ambrosial perfumes breathe
A fragrance, grateful to the sense,
And bliss, past utterance, dispense.
The heavy mists, encircling, wreath,
Disperse, and gradually unfold
A youthful female form;—she rode
Upon a rosy-tinted cloud;
Bright stream'd her flowing locks of gold;
She shone with radiant lustre bright,
And blazed with strange and dazzling light;
A diamond coronet deck'd her brow,
Bloom'd on her cheek a vermeil glow;
The terrors of her fiery eye
Pour'd forth insufferable day,
And shed a wildly lurid ray.
A smile upon her features play'd,
But there, too, sate pourtray'd
The inventive malice of a soul
Where wild demoniac passions roll;
Despair and torment on her brow,
Had mark'd a melancholy woe
In dark and deepen'd shade.
Under those hypocritic smiles,
Deceitful as the serpent's wiles,
Her hate and malice were conceal'd;
Whilst on her guilt-confessing face,
Conscience, the strongly printed trace
Of agony betray'd,
And all the fallen angel stood reveal'd.
She held a poniard in her hand,
The point was tinged by the lightning's brand;
In her left a scroll she bore,
Crimson'd deep with human gore;
And, as above my head she stood,
Bade me smear it with my blood.
She said, that when it was my doom
That every earthly pang should cease;
The evening of my mortal woe
Would close beneath the yawning tomb;
And, lull'd into the arms of death,
I should resign my labouring breath;
And in the sightless realms below
Enjoy an endless reign of peace.
She ceased—oh, God, I thank thy grace,
Which bade me spurn the deadly scroll;
Uncertain for a while I stood—
The dagger's point was in my blood.
Even now I bleed!—I bleed!
When suddenly what horrors flew,
Quick as the lightnings through my frame;
Flash'd on my mind the infernal deed,
The deed which would condemn my soul
To torments of eternal flame.
Drops colder than the cavern dew
Quick coursed each other down my face,
I labour'd for my breath;
At length I cried, ‘Avaunt! thou fiend of Hell,
Avaunt! thou minister of death!’
I cast the volume on the ground,
Loud shriek'd the fiend with piercing yell,
And more than mortal laughter peal'd around.
The scatter'd fragments of the storm
Floated along the Demon's form,
Dilating till it touched the sky;
The clouds that roll'd athwart his eye,
Reveal'd by its terrific ray,
Brilliant as the noontide day,
Gleam'd with a lurid fire;
Red lightnings darted around his head,
Thunders hoarse as the groans of the dead,
Pronounced their Maker's ire;
A whirlwind rush'd impetuous by,
Chaos of horror fill'd the sky;
I sunk convulsed with awe and dread.
When I waked the storm was fled,
But sounds unholy met my ear,
And fiends of hell were flitting near.
“Here let me pause—here end my tale,
My mental powers begin to fail;
At this short retrospect I faint:
Scarce beats my pulse—I lose my breath,
I sicken even unto death.
Oh! hard would be the task to paint
And gift with life past scenes again;
To knit a long and linkless chain,
Or strive minutely to relate
The varied horrors of my fate.
Rosa! I could a tale disclose,
So full of horror—full of woes,
Such as might blast a demon's ear,
Such as a fiend might shrink to hear—
But, no—”
Here ceased the tale. Convulsed with fear,
The tale yet lived in Rosa's ear—
She felt a strange mysterious dread,
A chilling awe as of the dead;
Gleamed on her sight the demon's form.
Heard she the fury of the storm?
The cries and hideous yells of death?
Tottered the ground her feet beneath?
Was it the fiend before her stood?
Saw she the poniard drop with blood?
All seemed to her distempered eye
A true and sad reality
[....]
“'Tis sixteen hundred years ago,
Since I came from Israel's land;
Sixteen hundred years of woe!—
With deep and furrowing hand,
God's mark is painted on my head;
Must there remain until the dead
Hear the last trump, and leave the tomb,
And earth spouts fire from her riven womb.
“How can I paint that dreadful day,
That time of terror and dismay,
When, for our sins, a Saviour died,
And the meek Lamb was crucified!
As dread that day, when borne along
To slaughter by the insulting throng,
Infuriate for Deicide,
I mocked our Saviour, and I cried,
Go, go, ‘Ah! I will go,’ said he,
‘Where scenes of endless bliss invite;
To the blest regions of the light
I go, but thou shalt here remain—
Thou diest not till I come again’—
E'en now, by horror traced, I see
His perforated feet and hands;
The madden'd crowd around him stands.
Pierces his side the ruffian spear,
Big rolls the bitter anguish'd tear.
Hark, that deep groan!—he dies—he dies.
And breathes, in death's last agonies,
Forgiveness to his enemies.
Then was the noon-day glory clouded,
The sun in pitchy darkness shrouded.
Then were strange forms through the darkness gleaming,
And the red orb of night on Jerusalem beaming;
Which faintly, with ensanguined light,
Dispersed the thickening shades of night.
Convulsed, all nature shook with fear,
As if the very end was near;
Earth to her centre trembled;
Rent in twain was the temple's vail,
The graves gave up their dead;
Whilst ghosts and spirits, ghastly pale,
Glared hideous on the sight,
Seen through the dark and lurid air,
As fiends array'd in light,
Threw on the scene a frightful glare,
And, howling, shriek'd with hideous yell—
They shriek'd in joy, for a Saviour fell!
'Twas then I felt the Almighty's ire;
Then full on my remembrance came
Those words despised alas! too late!
The horrors of my endless fate
Flashed on my soul and shook my frame;
They scorch'd my breast as with a flame
Of unextinguishable fire;
An exquisitely torturing pain
Of frenzying anguish fired my brain.
By keen remorse and anguish driven,
I called for vengeance down from Heaven.
But, ah! the all-wasting hand of Time,
Might never wear away my crime!
I scarce could draw my fluttering breath—
Was it the appalling grasp of death?
I lay entranced, and deemed he shed
His dews of poppy o'er my head;
But though the kindly warmth was dead,
The self-inflicted torturing pangs
Of conscience lent their scorpion fangs,
Still life prolonging, after life was fled.
“Methought, what glories met my sight,
As burst a sudden blaze of light,
Illumining the azure skies,
I saw the blessed Saviour rise.
But how unlike to him who bled!
Where then his thorn-encircled head?
Where the big drops of agony
Which dimmed the lustre of his eye?
Or deathlike hue that overspread
The features of that heavenly face?
Gone now was every mortal trace;
His eyes with radiant lustre beamed—
His form confessed celestial grace,
And with a blaze of glory streamed.
Innumerable hosts around,
Their brows with wreaths immortal crowned,
With amaranthine chaplets bound,
As on their wings the cross they bore,
Deep dyed in the Redeemer's gore,
Attune their golden harps, and sing
Loud hallelujahs to their King.
“But, in an instant, from my sight,
Fled were the visions of delight.
Darkness had spread her raven pall;
Dank, lurid darkness cover'd all.
All was as silent as the dead;
I felt a petrifying dread,
Which harrowed up my frame;
When suddenly a lurid stream
Of dark red light, with hideous gleam,
Shot like a meteor through the night,
And painted Hell upon the skies—
The Hell from whence it came.
What clouds of sulphur seemed to rise!
What sounds were borne upon the air!
The breathings of intense despair—
The piteous shrieks—the wails of woe—
The screams of torment and of pain—
The red-hot rack—the clanking chain!
I gazed upon the gulf below,
Till, fainting from excess of fear,
My tottering knees refused to bear
My odious weight. I sink—I sink!
Already had I reached the brink.
The fiery waves disparted wide,
To plunge me in their sulphurous tide;
When, racked by agonizing pain,
I started into life again.
“Yet still the impression left behind
Was deeply graven on my mind,
In characters whose inward trace
No change or time could e'er deface;
A burning cross illumed my brow,
I hid it with a fillet grey,
But could not hide the wasting woe
That wore my wildered soul away,
And ate my heart with living fire.
I knew it was the avenger's sway,
I felt it was the avenger's ire!
“A burden on the face of earth,
I cursed the mother who gave me birth;
I cursed myself—my native land.
Polluted by repeated crimes,
I sought in distant foreign climes
If change of country could bestow
A transient respite from my woe.
Vain from myself the attempt to fly,
Sole cause of my own misery.
“Since when, in death-like trance I lay,
Past, slowly past, the years away
That poured a bitter stream on me,
When once I fondly longed to see
Jerusalem, alas! my native place,
Jerusalem, alas! no more in name,
No portion of her former fame
Had left behind a single trace.
Her pomp, her splendour, was no more.
Her towers no longer seem to rise,
To lift their proud heads to the skies.
Fane and monumental bust,
Long levelled even with the dust.
The holy pavements were stained with gore.
The place where the sacred temple stood
Was crimson-dyed with Jewish blood.
Long since, my parents had been dead,
All my posterity had bled
Beneath the dark Crusader's spear,
No friend was left my path to cheer,
To shed a few last setting rays
Of sunshine on my evening days!
“Rack'd by the tortures of the mind,
How have I long'd to plunge beneath
The mansions of repelling death!
And strove that resting place to find
Where earthly sorrows cease.
Oft, when the tempest-fiends engaged,
And the warring winds tumultuous raged,
Confounding skies with seas,
Then would I rush to the towering height
Of the gigantic Teneriffe,
Or some precipitous cliff,
All in the dead of the silent night.
“I have cast myself from the mountain's height,
Above was day—below was night;
The substantial clouds that lower'd beneath
Bore my detested form;
They whirl'd it above the volcanic breath,
And the meteors of the storm;
The torrents of electric flame
Scorch'd to a cinder my fated frame.
Hark to the thunder's awful crash—
Hark to the midnight lightning's hiss!
At length was heard a sullen dash,
Which made the hollow rocks around
Rebellow to the awful sound;
The yawning ocean opening wide,
Received me in its vast abyss,
And whelm'd me in its foaming tide.
Though my astounded senses fled,
Yet did the spark of life remain;
Then the wild surges of the main
Dash'd and left me on the rocky shore.
Oh! would that I had waked no more!
Vain wish! I lived again to feel
Torments more fierce than those of hell!
A tide of keener pain to roll,
And the bruises to enter my inmost soul!
“I cast myself in Etna's womb,
If haply I might meet my doom,
In torrents of electric flame;
Thrice happy had I found a grave
'Mid fierce combustion's tumults dire,
'Mid oceans of volcanic fire
Which whirl'd me in their sulphurous wave,
And scorched to a cinder my hated frame,
Parch'd up the blood within my veins,
And rack'd my breast with damning pains;
Then hurl'd me from the mountain's entrails dread.
With what unutterable woe
Even now I feel this bosom glow—
I burn—I melt with fervent heat—
Again life's pulses wildly beat—
What endless throbbing pains I live to feel!
The elements respect their Maker's seal,—
That seal deep printed on my fated head.
“Still like the scathed pine-tree's height,
Braving the tempests of the night
Have I 'scaped the bickering fire.
Like the scathed pine which a monument stands
Of faded grandeur, which the brands
Of the tempest-shaken air
Have riven on the desolate heath,
Yet it stands majestic even in death,
And rears its wild form there.
Thus have I 'scaped the ocean's roar
The red-hot bolt from God's right hand,
The flaming midnight meteor brand,
And Etna's flames of bickering fire.
Thus am I doom'd by fate to stand,
A monument of the Eternal's ire;
Nor can this being pass away,
Till time shall be no more.
“I pierce with intellectual eye,
Into each hidden mystery;
I penetrate the fertile womb
Of nature; I produce to light
The secrets of the teeming earth,
And give air's unseen embryos birth:
The past, the present, and to come,
Float in review before my sight:
To me is known the magic spell,
To summon e'en the Prince of Hell;
Awed by the Cross upon my head,
His fiends would obey my mandates dread,
To twilight change the blaze of noon,
And stain with spots of blood the moon—
But that an interposing hand
Restrains my potent arts, my else supreme command.”
He raised his passion-quivering hand,
He loosed the grey encircling band,
A burning Cross was there;
Its colour was like to recent blood,
Deep marked upon his brow it stood,
And spread a lambent glare.
Dimmer grew the taper's blaze,
Dazzled by the brighter rays,
Whilst Paulo spoke—'twas dead of night—
Fair Rosa shuddered with affright;
Victorio, fearless, had braved death
Upon the blood-besprinkled heath;
Had heard, unmoved, the cannon's roar,
Echoing along the Wolga's shore.
When the thunder of battle was swelling,
When the birds for their dead prey were yelling,
When the ensigns of slaughter were streaming,
And falchions and bayonets were gleaming,
And almost felt death's chilling hand,
Stretched on ensanguined Wolga's strand,
And, careless, scorned for life to cry,
Yet now he turned aside his eye,
Scarce could his death-like terror bear,
And owned now what it was to fear.
“Once a funeral met my aching sight,
It blasted my eyes at the dead of night,
When the sightless fiends of the tempests rave,
And hell-birds howl o'er the storm-blacken'd wave.
Nought was seen, save at fits, but the meteor's glare
And the lightnings of God painting hell on the air;
Nought was heard save the thunder's wild voice in the sky,
And strange birds who, shrieking, fled dismally by.
'Twas then from my head my drench'd hair that I tore,
And bade my vain dagger's point drink my life's gore;
'Twas then I fell on the ensanguined earth,
And cursed the mother who gave me birth!
My maddened brain could bear no more—
Hark! the chilling whirlwind's roar;
The spirits of the tombless dead
Flit around my fated head,—
Howl horror and destruction round,
As they quaff my blood that stains the ground,
And shriek amid their deadly stave,—
‘Never shalt thou find the grave!
Ever shall thy fated soul
In life's protracted torments roll,
Till, in latest ruin hurl'd,
And fate's destruction, sinks the world!
Till the dead arise from the yawning ground,
To meet their Maker's last decree,
Till angels of vengeance flit around,
And loud yelling demons seize on thee!’
“Ah! would were come that fated hour,
When the clouds of chaos around shall lower;
When this globe calcined by the fury of God
Shall sink beneath his wrathful nod!”
As thus he spake, a wilder gaze
Of fiend-like horror lit his eye
With a most unearthly blaze,
As if some phantom-form passed by.
At last he stilled the maddening wail
Of grief, and thus pursued his tale:—
“Oft I invoke the fiends of hell,
And summon each in dire array—
I know they dare not disobey
My stern, my powerful spell.
—Once on a night, when not a breeze
Ruffled the surface of the seas,
The elements were lulled to rest,
And all was calm save my sad breast,
On death resolved—intent,
I marked a circle round my form;
About me sacred reliques spread,
The reliques of magicians dead,
And potent incantations read—
I waited their event.
“All at once grew dark the night,
Mists of swarthiness hung o'er the pale moonlight.
Strange yells were heard, the boding cry
Of the night raven that flitted by,
Whilst the silver winged mew
Startled with screams o'er the dark wave flew.
'Twas then I seized a magic wand,
The wand by an enchanter given,
And deep dyed in his heart's red blood.
The crashing thunder pealed aloud;
I saw the portentous meteor's glare
And the lightnings gleam o'er the lurid air;
I raised the wand in my trembling hand,
And pointed Hell's mark at the zenith of Heaven.
“A superhuman sound
Broke faintly on the listening ear,
Like to a silver harp the notes,
And yet they were more soft and clear.
I wildly strained my eyes around—
Again the unknown music floats.
Still stood Hell's mark above my head—
In wildest accents I summoned the dead—
And through the unsubstantial night,
It diffused a strange and fiendish light;
Spread its rays to the charnel-house air,
And marked mystic forms on the dark vapours there.
The winds had ceased—a thick dark smoke
From beneath the pavement broke;
Around ambrosial perfumes breathe
A fragrance, grateful to the sense,
And bliss, past utterance, dispense.
The heavy mists, encircling, wreath,
Disperse, and gradually unfold
A youthful female form;—she rode
Upon a rosy-tinted cloud;
Bright stream'd her flowing locks of gold;
She shone with radiant lustre bright,
And blazed with strange and dazzling light;
A diamond coronet deck'd her brow,
Bloom'd on her cheek a vermeil glow;
The terrors of her fiery eye
Pour'd forth insufferable day,
And shed a wildly lurid ray.
A smile upon her features play'd,
But there, too, sate pourtray'd
The inventive malice of a soul
Where wild demoniac passions roll;
Despair and torment on her brow,
Had mark'd a melancholy woe
In dark and deepen'd shade.
Under those hypocritic smiles,
Deceitful as the serpent's wiles,
Her hate and malice were conceal'd;
Whilst on her guilt-confessing face,
Conscience, the strongly printed trace
Of agony betray'd,
And all the fallen angel stood reveal'd.
She held a poniard in her hand,
The point was tinged by the lightning's brand;
In her left a scroll she bore,
Crimson'd deep with human gore;
And, as above my head she stood,
Bade me smear it with my blood.
She said, that when it was my doom
That every earthly pang should cease;
The evening of my mortal woe
Would close beneath the yawning tomb;
And, lull'd into the arms of death,
I should resign my labouring breath;
And in the sightless realms below
Enjoy an endless reign of peace.
She ceased—oh, God, I thank thy grace,
Which bade me spurn the deadly scroll;
Uncertain for a while I stood—
The dagger's point was in my blood.
Even now I bleed!—I bleed!
When suddenly what horrors flew,
Quick as the lightnings through my frame;
Flash'd on my mind the infernal deed,
The deed which would condemn my soul
To torments of eternal flame.
Drops colder than the cavern dew
Quick coursed each other down my face,
I labour'd for my breath;
At length I cried, ‘Avaunt! thou fiend of Hell,
Avaunt! thou minister of death!’
I cast the volume on the ground,
Loud shriek'd the fiend with piercing yell,
And more than mortal laughter peal'd around.
The scatter'd fragments of the storm
Floated along the Demon's form,
Dilating till it touched the sky;
The clouds that roll'd athwart his eye,
Reveal'd by its terrific ray,
Brilliant as the noontide day,
Gleam'd with a lurid fire;
Red lightnings darted around his head,
Thunders hoarse as the groans of the dead,
Pronounced their Maker's ire;
A whirlwind rush'd impetuous by,
Chaos of horror fill'd the sky;
I sunk convulsed with awe and dread.
When I waked the storm was fled,
But sounds unholy met my ear,
And fiends of hell were flitting near.
“Here let me pause—here end my tale,
My mental powers begin to fail;
At this short retrospect I faint:
Scarce beats my pulse—I lose my breath,
I sicken even unto death.
Oh! hard would be the task to paint
And gift with life past scenes again;
To knit a long and linkless chain,
Or strive minutely to relate
The varied horrors of my fate.
Rosa! I could a tale disclose,
So full of horror—full of woes,
Such as might blast a demon's ear,
Such as a fiend might shrink to hear—
But, no—”
Here ceased the tale. Convulsed with fear,
The tale yet lived in Rosa's ear—
She felt a strange mysterious dread,
A chilling awe as of the dead;
Gleamed on her sight the demon's form.
Heard she the fury of the storm?
The cries and hideous yells of death?
Tottered the ground her feet beneath?
Was it the fiend before her stood?
Saw she the poniard drop with blood?
All seemed to her distempered eye
A true and sad reality
[....]
Ah! why does man, whom God has sent
As the Creation's ornament,
Who stands amid his works confest
The first—the noblest—and the best;
Whose vast—whose comprehensive eye,
Is bounded only by the sky,
O'erlook the charms which Nature yields,
The garniture of woods and fields,
The sun's all vivifying light,
The glory of the moon by night,
And to himself alone a foe,
Forget from whom these blessings flow?
And is there not in friendship's eye,
Beaming with tender sympathy,
An antidote to every woe?
And cannot woman's love bestow
An heav'nly paradise below?
Such joys as these to man are given,
And yet you dare to rail at Heaven;
Vainly oppose the Almighty Cause,
Transgress His universal laws;
Forfeit the pleasures that await
The virtuous in this mortal state;
Question the goodness of the Power on high,
In misery live, despairing die.
What then is man, how few his days,
And heighten'd by what transient rays;
Made up of plans of happiness,
Of visionary schemes of bliss,
The varying passions of his mind
Inconstant, varying as the wind;
Now hush'd to apathetic rest,
Now tempested with storms his breast;
Now with the fluctuating tide
Sunk low in meanness, swoln with pride;
Thoughtless, or overwhelm'd with care,
Hoping, or tortured by despair!
The sun had sunk beneath the hill,
Soft fell the dew, the scene was still;
All nature hailed the evening's close.
Far more did lovely Rosa bless
The twilight of her happiness.
Even Paulo blest the tranquil hour
As in the aromatic bower,
Or wandering through the olive grove,
He told his plaintive tale of love;
But welcome to Victorio's soul
Did the dark clouds of evening roll!
But, ah! what means his hurried pace,
Those gestures strange, that varying face;
Now pale with mingled rage and ire,
Now burning with intense desire;
That brow where brood the imps of care,
That fixed expression of despair,
That haste, that labouring for breath—
His soul is madly bent on death.
A dark resolve is in his eye,
Victorio raves—I hear him cry,
“Rosa is Paulo's eternally.”
But whence is that soul-harrowing moan,
Deep drawn and half supprest—
A low and melancholy tone,
That rose upon the wind?
Victorio wildly gazed around,
He cast his eyes upon the ground,
He raised them to the spangled air,
But all was still—was quiet there.
Hence, hence, this superstitious fear;
'Twas but the fever of his mind
That conjured the ideal sound,
To his distempered ear.
With rapid step, with frantic haste,
He scoured the long and dreary waste;
And now the gloomy cypress spread
Its darkened umbrage o'er his head;
The stately pines above him high,
Lifted their tall heads to the sky;
Whilst o'er his form, the poisonous yew
And melancholy nightshade threw
Their baleful deadly dew.
At intervals the moon shone clear;
Yet, passing o'er her disk, a cloud
Would now her silver beauty shroud.
The autumnal leaf was parched and sere;
It rustled like a step to fear.
The precipice's battled height
Was dimly seen through the mists of night,
As Victorio moved along.
At length he reach'd its summit dread,
The night-wind whistled round his head
A wild funereal song.
A dying cadence swept around
Upon the waste of air,
It scarcely might be called a sound,
For stillness yet was there,
Save when the roar of the waters below
Was wafted by fits to the mountain's brow.
Here for a while Victorio stood
Suspended o'er the yawning flood,
And gazed upon the gulf beneath.
No apprehension paled his cheek,
No sighs from his torn bosom break,
No terror dimm'd his eye.
“Welcome, thrice welcome, friendly death,”
In desperate harrowing tone he cried,
“Receive me, ocean, to your breast,
Hush this ungovernable tide,
This troubled sea to rest.
Thus do I bury all my grief—
This plunge shall give my soul relief,
This plunge into eternity!”
I see him now about to spring
Into the watery grave:
Hark! the death angel flaps his wing
O'er the blacken'd wave.
Hark! the night-raven shrieks on high
To the breeze which passes on;
Clouds o'ershade the moonlight sky—
The deadly work is almost done—
When a soft and silver sound,
Softer than the fairy song,
Which floats at midnight hour along
The daisy-spangled ground,
Was borne upon the wind's soft swell.
Victorio started—'twas the knell
Of some departed soul;
Now on the pinion of the blast,
Which o'er the craggy mountain past,
The lengthen'd murmurs roll—
Till lost in ether, dies away
The plaintive, melancholy lay.
'Tis said congenial sounds have power
To dissipate the mists that lower
Upon the wretch's brow—
To still the maddening passions' war—
To calm the mind's impetuous jar—
To turn the tide of woe.
Victorio shudder'd with affright,
Swam o'er his eyes thick mists of night;
Even now he was about to sink
Into the ocean's yawning womb,
But that the branches of an oak,
Which, riven by the lightning's stroke,
O'erhung the precipice's brink,
Preserved him from the billowy tomb;
Quick throbb'd his pulse with feverish heat,
He wildly started on his feet,
And rush'd from the mountain's height.
The moon was down, but thro' the air
Wild meteors spread a transient glare,
Borne on the wing of the swelling gale,
Above the dark and woody dale,
Thick clouds obscured the sky.
All was now wrapped in silence drear,
Not a whisper broke on the listening ear,
Not a murmur floated by.
In thought's perplexing labyrinth lost
The trackless heath he swiftly crost.
Ah! why did terror blanch his cheek?
Why did his tongue attempt to speak,
And fail in the essay?
Through the dark midnight mists, an eye,
Flashing with crimson brilliancy,
Poured on his face its ray.
What sighs pollute the midnight air?
What mean those breathings of despair?
Thus asked a voice, whose hollow tone
Might seem but one funereal moan.
Victorio groaned, with faltering breath,
“I burn with love, I pant for death!”
Suddenly a meteor's glare,
With brilliant flash illumed the air;
Bursting through clouds of sulphurous smoke,
As on a Witch's form it broke,
Of herculean bulk her frame
Seemed blasted by the lightning's flame;
Her eyes that flared with lurid light,
Were now with bloodshot lustre filled.
They blazed like comets through the night,
And now thick rheumy gore distilled;
Black as the raven's plume, her locks
Loose streamed upon the pointed rocks;
Wild floated on the hollow gale,
Or swept the ground in matted trail;
Vile loathsome weeds, whose pitchy fold
Were blackened by the fire of Hell,
Her shapeless limbs of giant mould
Scarce served to hide—as she the while
“Grinned horribly a ghastly smile”
And shrieked with demon yell.
Terror unmanned Victorio's mind,
His limbs, like lime leaves in the wind,
Shook, and his brain in wild dismay
Swam—Vainly he strove to turn away.
“Follow me to the mansions of rest,”
The weird female cried;
The life-blood rushed thro' Victorio's breast
In full and swelling tide.
Attractive as the eagle's gaze,
And bright as the meridian blaze,
Led by a sanguine stream of light,
He followed through the shades of night—
Before him his conductress fled,
As swift as the ghosts of the dead,
When on some dreadful errand they fly,
In a thunderblast sweeping the sky.
They reached a rock whose beetling height
Was dimly seen thro' the clouds of night;
Illumined by the meteor's blaze,
Its wild crags caught the reddened rays
And their refracted brilliance threw
Around a solitary yew,
Which stretched its blasted form on high,
Braving the tempests of the sky.
As glared the flame—a caverned cell,
More pitchy than the shades of hell,
Lay open to Victorio's view.
Lost for an instant was his guide;
He rushed into the mountain's side.
At length with deep and harrowing yell
She bade him quickly speed,
For that ere again had risen the moon
'Twas fated that there must be done
A strange—a deadly deed.
Swift as the wind Victorio sped;
Beneath him lay the mangled dead
Around dank putrefaction's power
Had caused a dim blue mist to lower.
Yet an unfixed, a wandering light
Dispersed the thickening shades of night;
Yet the weird female's features dire
Gleamed thro' the lurid yellow air:
With a deadly livid fire,
Whose wild, inconstant, dazzling light
Dispelled the tenfold shades of night,
Whilst her hideous fiendlike eye
Fixed on her victim with horrid stare
Flamed with more kindled radiancy;
More frightful far than that of Death,
When exulting he stalks o'er the battle heath;
Or of the dread prophetic form,
Who rides the curled clouds in the storm,
And borne upon the tempest's wings,
Death, despair, and horror brings.
Strange voices then and shrieks of death
Were borne along the trackless heath;
Tottered the ground his steps beneath;
Rustled the blast o'er the dark cliff's side,
And their works unhallowed spirits plied,
As they shed their baneful breath.
Yet Victorio hastened on—
Soon the dire deed will be done.
“Mortal,” the female cried, “this night
Shall dissipate thy woe;
And, ere return of morning light
The clouds that shade thy brow,
Like fleeting summer mists shall fly
Before the sun that mounts on high.
I know the wishes of thy heart—
A soothing balm I could impart:
Rosa is Paulo's—can be thine,
For the secret power is mine.”
“Give me that secret power—Oh! give
To me fair Rosa—I will live
To bow to thy command.
Rosa but mine—and I will fly
E'en to the regions of the sky,
Will traverse every land.”
“Calm then those transports and attend,
Mortal, to one, who is thy friend—
The charm begins.”
An ancient book
Of mystic characters she took;
Her loose locks floated on the air;
Her eyes were fixed in lifeless stare:
She traced a circle on the floor,
Around dank chilling vapours lower:
A golden cross on the pavement she threw,
'Twas tinged with a flame of lambent blue,
From which bright scintillations flew;
By it she cursed her Saviour's soul;
Around strange fiendish laughs did roll,
A hollow, wild, and frightful sound,
At fits was heard to float around.
She uttered then, in accents dread,
Some maddening rhyme that wakes the dead,
And forces every shivering fiend,
To her their demon-forms to bend;
At length a wild and piercing shriek,
As the dark mists disperse and break,
Announced the coming Prince of Hell—
His horrid form obscured the cell.
Victorio shrunk, unused to shrink,
E'en at extremest danger's brink;
The witch then pointed to the ground,
Infernal shadows flitted around,
And with their prince were seen to rise,
The cavern bellows with their cries,
Which echoing through a thousand caves,
Sound like as many tempest waves.
Inspired and wrapt in bickering flame,
The strange, the awful being stood.
Words unpremeditated came,
In unintelligible flood,
From her black tumid lips,—array'd
In livid fiendish smiles of joy;
Lips, which now dropped with deadly dew,
And now, extending wide, displayed,
Projecting teeth of mouldy hue,
As with a loud and piercing cry,
A mystic, harrowing lay she sang,
Along the rocks a death-peal rang.
In accents hollow, deep and drear,
They struck upon Victorio's ear.
As ceased the soul-appalling verse,
Obedient to its power, grew still
The hellish shrieks;—the mists disperse;—
Satan—a shapeless, hideous beast—
In all his horrors stood confest!
And as his vast proportions fill
The lofty cave, his features dire
Gleam with a pale and sulphurous fire;
From his fixed glance of deadly hate
Even she shrunk back, appalled with dread—
For there contempt and malice sate,
And from his basiliskine eye
Sparks of living fury fly,
Which wanted but a being to strike dead.
A wilder, a more awful spell
Now echoed through the long-drawn cell;
The demon bowed to its mandates dread.
“Receive this potent drug,” he cried,
“Whoever quaffs its fatal tide,
Is mingled with the dead.”
Swept by a rushing sulphurous blast,
Which wildly through the cavern past,
The fatal word was borne.
The cavern trembled with the sound,
Trembled beneath his feet the ground,
With strong convulsions torn,
Victorio, shuddering, fell;
But soon awakening from his trance,
He cast around a fearful glance,
Yet gloomy was the cell,
Save where a lamp's uncertain flare
Cast a flickering, dying glare.
“Calm then those transports and attend,
Mortal, to one, who is thy friend—
The charm begins.”

“Receive this dear-earned drug—its power
Thou, mortal, soon shalt know:
This drug shall be thy nuptial dower,
This drug shall seal thy woe.
Mingle it with Rosa's wine,
Victorio—Rosa then is thine.”
She spake, and, to confirm the spell,
A strange and subterranean sound
Reverberated long around,
In dismal echoes—the dark cell
Rocked as in terror—thro' the sky
Hoarse thunders murmured awfully,
And winged with horror, darkness spread
Her mantle o'er Victorio's head.
He gazed around with dizzy fear,
No fiend, no witch, no cave, was near;
But the blasts of the forest were heard to roar,
The wild ocean's billows to dash on the shore.
The cold winds of Heaven struck chill on his frame;
For the cave had been heated by hell's blackening flame,
And his hand grasped a casket—the philtre was there!
[....]
Sweet is the whispering of the breeze
Which scarcely sways yon summer trees;
Sweet is the pale moon's pearly beam,
Which sleeps upon the silver stream,
In slumber cold and still:
Sweet those wild notes of harmony,
Which on the blast that passes by,
Are wafted from yon hill;
So low, so thrilling, yet so clear,
Which strike enthusiast fancy's ear:
Which sweep along the moonlight sky,
Like notes of heavenly symphony.
See yon opening flower
Spreads its fragrance to the blast;
It fades within an hour,
Its decay is pale, is fast.
Paler is yon maiden;
Faster is her heart's decay;
Deep with sorrow laden,
She sinks in death away.
[....]
'Tis the silent dead of night—
Hark! hark! what shriek so low yet clear,
Breaks on calm rapture's pensive ear,
From Lara's castled height?
'Twas Rosa's death-shriek fell!
What sound is that which rides the blast,
As onward its fainter murmurs past?
'Tis Rosa's funeral knell!
What step is that the ground which shakes?
'Tis the step of a wretch, nature shrinks from his tread;
And beneath their tombs tremble the shuddering dead;
And while he speaks the churchyard quakes.

“Lies she there for the worm to devour,
Lies she there till the judgment hour,
Is then my Rosa dead!
False fiend! I curse thy futile power!
O'er her form will lightnings flash,
O'er her form will thunders crash,
But harmless from my head
Will the fierce tempest's fury fly,
Rebounding to its native sky.—
Who is the God of Mercy?—where
Enthroned the power to save?
Reigns he above the viewless air?
Lives he beneath the grave?
To him would I lift my suppliant moan,
That power should hear my harrowing groan;—
Is it then Christ's terrific Sire?
Ah! I have felt his burning ire,
I feel,—I feel it now,—
His flaming mark is fix'd on my head,
And must there remain in traces dread;
Wild anguish glooms my brow;
Oh! Griefs like mine that fiercely burn,
Where is the balm can heal!
Where is the monumental urn
Can bid to dust this frame return,
Or quench the pangs I feel!”
As thus he spoke grew dark the sky,
Hoarse thunders murmured awfully,
“O Demon! I am thine!” he cried.
A hollow fiendish voice replied,
“Come! for thy doom is misery.”



Ever as now with Love and Virtue's glow
May thy unwithering soul not cease to burn,
Still may thine heart with those pure thoughts o'erflow
Which force from mine such quick and warm return.



It is not blasphemy to hope that Heaven
More perfectly will give those nameless joys
Which throb within the pulses of the blood
And sweeten all that bitterness which Earth
Infuses in the heaven-born soul. O thou
Whose dear love gleamed upon the gloomy path
Which this lone spirit travelled, drear and cold,
Yet swiftly leading to those awful limits
Which mark the bounds of Time and of the space
When Time shall be no more; wilt thou not turn
Those spirit-beaming eyes and look on me,
Until I be assured that Earth is Heaven,
And Heaven is Earth?—will not thy glowing cheek,
Glowing with soft suffusion, rest on mine,
And breathe magnetic sweetness through the frame
Of my corporeal nature, through the soul
Now knit with these fine fibres? I would give
The longest and the happiest day that fate
Has marked on my existence but to feel
One soul-reviving kiss. . . O thou most dear,
'Tis an assurance that this Earth is Heaven,
And Heaven the flower of that untainted seed
Which springeth here beneath such love as ours.
Harriet! let death all mortal ties dissolve,
But ours shall not be mortal! The cold hand
Of Time may chill the love of earthly minds
Half frozen now; the frigid intercourse
Of common souls lives but a summer's day;
It dies, where it arose, upon this earth.
But ours! oh, 'tis the stretch of Fancy's hope
To portray its continuance as now,
Warm, tranquil, spirit-healing; nor when age
Has tempered these wild ecstasies, and given
A soberer tinge to the luxurious glow
Which blazing on devotion's pinnacle
Makes virtuous passion supersede the power
Of reason; nor when life's aestival sun
To deeper manhood shall have ripened me;
Nor when some years have added judgement's store
To all thy woman sweetness, all the fire
Which throbs in thine enthusiast heart; not then
Shall holy friendship (for what other name
May love like ours assume?), not even then
Shall Custom so corrupt, or the cold forms
Of this desolate world so harden us,
As when we think of the dear love that binds
Our souls in soft communion, while we know
Each other's thoughts and feelings, can we say
Unblushingly a heartless compliment,
Praise, hate, or love with the unthinking world,
Or dare to cut the unrelaxing nerve
That knits our love to virtue. Can those eyes,
Beaming with mildest radiance on my heart
To purify its purity, e'er bend
To soothe its vice or consecrate its fears?
Never, thou second Self! Is confidence
So vain in virtue that I learn to doubt
The mirror even of Truth? Dark flood of Time,
Roll as it listeth thee; I measure not
By month or moments thy ambiguous course.
Another may stand by me on thy brink,
And watch the bubble whirled beyond his ken,
Which pauses at my feet. The sense of love,
The thirst for action, and the impassioned thought
Prolong my being; if I wake no more,
My life more actual living will contain
Than some gray veteran's of the world's cold school,
Whose listless hours unprofitably roll
By one enthusiast feeling unredeemed,
Virtue and Love! unbending Fortitude,
Freedom, Devotedness and Purity!
That life my Spirit consecrates to you.



See yon opening flower
    Spreads its fragrance to the blast;
It fades within an hour,
    Its decay is pale—is fast.
Paler is yon maiden;
    Faster is her heart's decay;
Deep with sorrow laden,
    She sinks in death away.



Away! the moor is dark beneath the moon,
    Rapid clouds have drank the last pale beam of even:
Away! the gathering winds will call the darkness soon,
    And profoundest midnight shroud the serene lights of heaven.
Pause not! The time is past! Every voice cries, Away!
    Tempt not with one last tear thy friend's ungentle mood:
Thy lover's eye, so glazed and cold, dares not entreat thy stay:
    Duty and dereliction guide thee back to solitude.
Away, away! to thy sad and silent home;
    Pour bitter tears on its desolated hearth;
Watch the dim shades as like ghosts they go and come,
    And complicate strange webs of melancholy mirth.
The leaves of wasted autumn woods shall float around thine head:
    The blooms of dewy spring shall gleam beneath thy feet:
But thy soul or this world must fade in the frost that binds the dead,
    Ere midnight's frown and morning's smile, ere thou and peace may meet.
The cloud shadows of midnight possess their own repose,
    For the weary winds are silent, or the moon is in the deep:
Some respite to its turbulence unresting ocean knows;
    Whatever moves, or toils, or grieves, hath its appointed sleep.
Thou in the grave shalt rest—yet till the phantoms flee
    Which that house and heath and garden made dear to thee erewhile,
Thy remembrance, and repentance, and deep musings are not free
    From the music of two voices and the light of one sweet smile.



A glorious people vibrated again
    The lightning of the nations: Liberty
From heart to heart, from tower to tower, o'er Spain,
    Scattering contagious fire into the sky,
Gleamed. My soul spurned the chains of its dismay,
            And in the rapid plumes of song
            Clothed itself, sublime and strong,
(As a young eagle soars the morning clouds among.)
    Hovering in verse o'er its accustomed prey;
        Till from its station in the Heaven of fame
    The Spirit's whirlwind rapped it, and the ray
        Of the remotest sphere of living flame
Which paves the void was from behind it flung,
    As foam from a ship's swiftness, when there came
    A voice out of the deep: I will record the same.
The Sun and the serenest Moon sprang forth:
    The burning stars of the abyss were hurled
Into the depths of Heaven. The daedal earth,
    That island in the ocean of the world,
Hung in its cloud of all-sustaining air:
            But this divinest universe
            Was yet a chaos and a curse,
For thou wert not: but, power from worst producing worse,
    The spirit of the beasts was kindled there,
        And of the birds, and of the watery forms,
    And there was war among them, and despair
        Within them, raging without truce or terms:
The bosom of their violated nurse
    Groaned, for beasts warred on beasts, and worms on worms,
    And men on men; each heart was as a hell of storms.
Man, the imperial shape, then multiplied
    His generations under the pavilion
Of the Sun's throne: palace and pyramid,
    Temple and prison, to many a swarming million
Were, as to mountain-wolves their raggèd caves.
            This human living multitude
            Was savage, cunning, blind, and rude,
For thou wert not; but o'er the populous solitude,
    Like one fierce cloud over a waste of waves,
        Hung Tyranny; beneath, sate deified
    The sister-pest, congregator of slaves;
        Into the shadow of her pinions wide
Anarchs and priests, who feed on gold and blood
    Till with the stain their inmost souls are dyed,
    Drove the astonished herds of men from every side.
The nodding promontories, and blue isles,
    And cloud-like mountains, and dividuous waves
Of Greece, basked glorious in the open smiles
    Of favouring Heaven: from their enchanted caves
Prophetic echoes flung dim melody.
            On the unapprehensive wild
            The vine, the corn, the olive mild,
Grew savage yet, to human use unreconciled;
    And, like unfolded flowers beneath the sea,
        Like the man's thought dark in the infant's brain,
    Like aught that is which wraps what is to be,
        Art's deathless dreams lay veiled by many a vein
Of Parian stone; and, yet a speechless child,
    Verse murmured, and Philosophy did strain
    Her lidless eyes for thee; when o'er the Aegean main
Athens arose: a city such as vision
    Builds from the purple crags and silver towers
Of battlemented cloud, as in derision
    Of kingliest masonry: the ocean-floors
Pave it; the evening sky pavilions it;
            Its portals are inhabited
            By thunder-zonèd winds, each head
Within its cloudy wings with sun-fire garlanded,—
    A divine work! Athens, diviner yet,
        Gleamed with its crest of columns, on the will
    Of man, as on a mount of diamond, set;
        For thou wert, and thine all-creative skill
Peopled, with forms that mock the eternal dead
    In marble immortality, that hill
    Which was thine earliest throne and latest oracle.
Within the surface of Time's fleeting river
    Its wrinkled image lies, as then it lay
Immovably unquiet, and for ever
    It trembles, but it cannot pass away!
The voices of thy bards and sages thunder
            With an earth-awakening blast
            Through the caverns of the past:
(Religion veils her eyes; Oppression shrinks aghast:)
    A wingèd sound of joy, and love, and wonder,
        Which soars where Expectation never flew,
    Rending the veil of space and time asunder!
        One ocean feeds the clouds, and streams, and dew;
One Sun illumines Heaven; one Spirit vast
    With life and love makes chaos ever new,
    As Athens doth the world with thy delight renew.
Then Rome was, and from thy deep bosom fairest,
    Like a wolf-cub from a Cadmaean Maenad ,
She drew the milk of greatness, though thy dearest
    From that Elysian food was yet unweanèd;
And many a deed of terrible uprightness
            By thy sweet love was sanctified;
            And in thy smile, and by thy side,
Saintly Camillus lived, and firm Atilius died.
    But when tears stained thy robe of vestal whiteness,
        And gold profaned thy Capitolian throne,
    Thou didst desert, with spirit-wingèd lightness,
        The senate of the tyrants: they sunk prone
Slaves of one tyrant: Palatinus sighed
    Faint echoes of Ionian song; that tone
    Thou didst delay to hear, lamenting to disown.
From what Hyrcanian glen or frozen hill,
    Or piny promontory of the Arctic main,
Or utmost islet inaccessible,
    Didst thou lament the ruin of thy reign,
Teaching the woods and waves, and desert rocks,
            And every Naiad's ice-cold urn,
            To talk in echoes sad and stern
Of that sublimest lore which man had dared unlearn?
    For neither didst thou watch the wizard flocks
        Of the Scald's dreams, nor haunt the Druid's sleep.
    What if the tears rained through thy shattered locks
        Were quickly dried? for thou didst groan, not weep,
When from its sea of death, to kill and burn,
    The Galilean serpent forth did creep,
    And made thy world an undistinguishable heap.
A thousand years the Earth cried, ‘Where art thou?’
    And then the shadow of thy coming fell
On Saxon Alfred's olive-cinctured brow:
    And many a warrior-peopled citadel,
Like rocks which fire lifts out of the flat deep,
            Arose in sacred Italy,
            Frowning o'er the tempestuous sea
Of kings, and priests, and slaves, in tower-crowned majesty;
    That multitudinous anarchy did sweep
        And burst around their walls, like idle foam,
    Whilst from the human spirit's deepest deep
        Strange melody with love and awe struck dumb
Dissonant arms; and Art, which cannot die,
    With divine wand traced on our earthly home
    Fit imagery to pave Heaven's everlasting dome.
Thou huntress swifter than the Moon! thou terror
    Of the world's wolves! thou bearer of the quiver,
Whose sunlike shafts pierce tempest-wingèd Error,
    As light may pierce the clouds when they dissever
In the calm regions of the orient day!
            Luther caught thy wakening glance;
            Like lightning, from his leaden lance
Reflected, it dissolved the visions of the trance
    In which, as in a tomb, the nations lay;
        And England's prophets hailed thee as their queen,
    In songs whose music cannot pass away,
        Though it must flow forever: not unseen
Before the spirit-sighted countenance
    Of Milton didst thou pass, from the sad scene
    Beyond whose night he saw, with a dejected mien.
The eager hours and unreluctant years
    As on a dawn-illumined mountain stood,
Trampling to silence their loud hopes and fears,
    Darkening each other with their multitude,
And cried aloud, ‘Liberty!’ Indignation
            Answered Pity from her cave;
            Death grew pale within the grave,
And Desolation howled to the destroyer, Save!
    When like Heaven's Sun girt by the exhalation
        Of its own glorious light, thou didst arise,
    Chasing thy foes from nation unto nation
        Like shadows: as if day had cloven the skies
At dreaming midnight o'er the western wave,
    Men started, staggering with a glad surprise,
    Under the lightnings of thine unfamiliar eyes.
Thou Heaven of earth! what spells could pall thee then
    In ominous eclipse? a thousand years
Bred from the slime of deep Oppression's den,
    Dyed all thy liquid light with blood and tears,
Till thy sweet stars could weep the stain away;
            How like Bacchanals of blood
            Round France, the ghastly vintage, stood
Destruction's sceptred slaves, and Folly's mitred brood!
    When one, like them, but mightier far than they,
        The Anarch of thine own bewildered powers,
    Rose: armies mingled in obscure array,
        Like clouds with clouds, darkening the sacred bowers
Of serene Heaven. He, by the past pursued,
    Rests with those dead, but unforgotten hours,
    Whose ghosts scare victor kings in their ancestral towers.
England yet sleeps: was she not called of old?
    Spain calls her now, as with its thrilling thunder
Vesuvius wakens Aetna, and the cold
    Snow-crags by its reply are cloven in sunder:
O'er the lit waves every Aeolian isle
            From Pithecusa to Pelorus
            Howls, and leaps, and glares in chorus:
They cry, ‘Be dim; ye lamps of Heaven suspended o'er us!’
    Her chains are threads of gold, she need but smile
        And they dissolve; but Spain's were links of steel,
    Till bit to dust by virtue's keenest file.
        Twins of a single destiny! appeal
To the eternal years enthroned before us
    In the dim West; impress us from a seal,
        All ye have thought and done! Time cannot dare conceal.
Tomb of Arminius! render up thy dead
    Till, like a standard from a watch-tower's staff,
His soul may stream over the tyrant's head;
    Thy victory shall be his epitaph,
Wild Bacchanal of truth's mysterious wine,
            King-deluded Germany,
            His dead spirit lives in thee.
Why do we fear or hope? thou art already free!
    And thou, lost Paradise of this divine
        And glorious world! thou flowery wilderness!
    Thou island of eternity! thou shrine
        Where Desolation, clothed with loveliness,
Worships the thing thou wert! O Italy,
    Gather thy blood into thy heart; repress
    The beasts who make their dens thy sacred palaces.
Oh, that the free would stamp the impious name
    Of King into the dust! or write it there,
So that this blot upon the page of fame
    Were as a serpent's path, which the light air
Erases, and the flat sands close behind!
            Ye the oracle have heard:
            Lift the victory-flashing sword,
And cut the snaky knots of this foul gordian word,
    Which, weak itself as stubble, yet can bind
        Into a mass, irrefragably firm,
    The axes and the rods which awe mankind;
        The sound has poison in it, 'tis the sperm
Of what makes life foul, cankerous, and abhorred;
    Disdain not thou, at thine appointed term,
    To set thine armèd heel on this reluctant worm.
Oh, that the wise from their bright minds would kindle
    Such lamps within the dome of this dim world,
That the pale name of Priest might shrink and dwindle
    Into the hell from which it first was hurled,
A scoff of impious pride from fiends impure;
            Till human thoughts might kneel alone,
            Each before the judgement-throne
Of its own aweless soul, or of the Power unknown!
    Oh, that the words which make the thoughts obscure
        From which they spring, as clouds of glimmering dew
    From a white lake blot Heaven's blue portraiture,
        Were stripped of their thin masks and various hue
And frowns and smiles and splendours not their own,
    Till in the nakedness of false and true
    They stand before their Lord, each to receive its due!
He who taught man to vanquish whatsoever
    Can be between the cradle and the grave
Crowned him the King of Life. Oh, vain endeavour!
    If on his own high will, a willing slave,
He has enthroned the oppression and the oppressor.
            What if earth can clothe and feed
            Amplest millions at their need,
And power in thought be as the tree within the seed?
    Or what if Art, an ardent intercessor,
        Driving on fiery wings to Nature's throne,
    Checks the great mother stooping to caress her,
        And cries: ‘Give me, thy child, dominion
Over all height and depth’? if Life can breed
    New wants, and wealth from those who toil and groan,
    Rend of thy gifts and hers a thousandfold for one!
Come thou, but lead out of the inmost cave
    Of man's deep spirit, as the morning-star
Beckons the Sun from the Eoan wave,
    Wisdom. I hear the pennons of her car
Self-moving, like cloud charioted by flame;
            Comes she not, and come ye not,
            Rulers of eternal thought,
To judge, with solemn truth, life's ill-apportioned lot?
    Blind Love, and equal Justice, and the Fame
        Of what has been, the Hope of what will be?
    O Liberty! if such could be thy name
        Wert thou disjoined from these, or they from thee:
If thine or theirs were treasures to be bought
    By blood or tears, have not the wise and free
    Wept tears, and blood like tears?—The solemn harmony
Paused, and the Spirit of that mighty singing
    To its abyss was suddenly withdrawn;
Then, as a wild swan, when sublimely winging
    Its path athwart the thunder-smoke of dawn,
Sinks headlong through the aëreal golden light
            On the heavy-sounding plain,
            When the bolt has pierced its brain;
As summer clouds dissolve, unburthened of their rain;
    As a far taper fades with fading night,
        As a brief insect dies with dying day,—
    My song, its pinions disarrayed of might,
        Drooped; o'er it closed the echoes far away
Of the great voice which did its flight sustain,
    As waves which lately paved his watery way
    Hiss round a drowner's head in their tempestuous play.



And said I that all hope was fled,
    That sorrow and despair were mine,
That each enthusiast wish was dead,
    Had sank beneath pale Misery's shrine.—
Seest thou the sunbeam's yellow glow,
    That robes with liquid streams of light;
Yon distant Mountain's craggy brow.
    And shows the rocks so fair,—so bright 
Tis thus sweet expectation's ray,
    In softer view shows distant hours,
And portrays each succeeding day,
    As dressed in fairer, brighter flowers,—
The vermeil tinted flowers that blossom;
    Are frozen but to bud anew,
Then sweet deceiver calm my bosom,
    Although thy visions be not true,—
Yet true they are,—and I'll believe,
    Thy whisperings soft of love and peace,
God never made thee to deceive,
    'Tis sin that bade thy empire cease.
Yet though despair my life should gloom,
    Though horror should around me close,
With those I love, beyond the tomb,
    Hope shows a balm for all my woes.



[I am afraid these verses will not please you, but]
If I esteemed you less, Envy would kill
Pleasure, and leave to Wonder and Despair
The ministration of the thoughts that fill
The mind which, like a worm whose life may share
A portion of the unapproachable,
Marks your creations rise as fast and fair
As perfect worlds at the Creator's will.
But such is my regard that nor your power
To soar above the heights where others [climb],
Nor fame, that shadow of the unborn hour
Cast from the envious future on the time,
Move one regret for his unhonoured name
Who dares these words:—the worm beneath the sod
May lift itself in homage of the God.



My Song, I fear that thou wilt find but few
Who fitly shall conceive thy reasoning,
Of such hard matter dost thou entertain;
Whence, if by misadventure, chance should bring
Thee to base company (as chance may do),
Quite unaware of what thou dost contain,
I prithee, comfort thy sweet self again,
My last delight! tell them that they are dull,
And bid them own that thou art beautiful.
Sweet Spirit! Sister of that orphan one,
Whose empire is the name thou weepest on,
In my heart's temple I suspend to thee
These votive wreaths of withered memory.
Poor captive bird! who, from thy narrow cage,
Pourest such music, that it might assuage
The ruggèd hearts of those who prisoned thee,
Were they not deaf to all sweet melody;
This song shall be thy rose: its petals pale
Are dead, indeed, my adored Nightingale!
But soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,
And it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.
High, spirit-wingèd Heart! who dost for ever
Beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,
Till those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed
It over-soared this low and worldly shade,
Lie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast
Stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest!
I weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,
Yet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.
Seraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,
Veiling beneath that radiant form of Woman
All that is insupportable in thee
Of light, and love, and immortality!
Sweet Benediction in the eternal Curse!
Veiled Glory of this lampless Universe!
Thou Moon beyond the clouds! Thou living Form
Among the Dead! Thou Star above the Storm!
Thou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thou Terror!
Thou Harmony of Nature's art! Thou Mirror
In whom, as in the splendour of the Sun,
All shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!
Ay, even the dim words which obscure thee now
Flash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow;
I pray thee that thou blot from this sad song
All of its much mortality and wrong,
With those clear drops, which start like sacred dew
From the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,
Weeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy:
Then smile on it, so that it may not die.
I never thought before my death to see
Youth's vision thus made perfect. Emily,
I love thee; though the world by no thin name
Will hide that love from its unvalued shame.
Would we two had been twins of the same mother!
Or, that the name my heart lent to another
Could be a sister's bond for her and thee,
Blending two beams of one eternity!
Yet were one lawful and the other true,
These names, though dear, could paint not, as is due,
How beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me!
I am not thine: I am a part of thee.
Sweet Lamp! my moth-like Muse has burned its wings
Or, like a dying swan who soars and sings,
Young Love should teach Time, in his own gray style,
All that thou art. Art thou not void of guile,
A lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless?
A well of sealed and secret happiness,
Whose waters like blithe light and music are,
Vanquishing dissonance and gloom? A Star
Which moves not in the moving heavens, alone?
A Smile amid dark frowns? a gentle tone
Amid rude voices? a belovèd light?
A Solitude, a Refuge, a Delight?
A Lute, which those whom Love has taught to play
Make music on, to soothe the roughest day
And lull fond Grief asleep? a buried treasure?
A cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?
A violet-shrouded grave of Woe?—I measure
The world of fancies, seeking one like thee,
And find—alas! mine own infirmity.
She met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,
And lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,
Winter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,
Led into light, life, peace. An antelope,
In the suspended impulse of its lightness,
Were less aethereally light: the brightness
Of her divinest presence trembles through
Her limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew
Embodied in the windless heaven of June
Amid the splendour-wingèd stars, the Moon
Burns, inextinguishably beautiful:
And from her lips, as from a hyacinth full
Of honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,
Killing the sense with passion; sweet as stops
Of planetary music heard in trance.
In her mild lights the starry spirits dance,
The sunbeams of those wells which ever leap
Under the lightnings of the soul—too deep
For the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.
The glory of her being, issuing thence,
Stains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade
Of unentangled intermixture, made
By Love, of light and motion: one intense
Diffusion, one serene Omnipresence,
Whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,
Around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing
With the unintermitted blood, which there
Quivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air
The crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)
Continuously prolonged, and ending never,
Till they are lost, and in that Beauty furled
Which penetrates and clasps and fills the world;
Scarce visible from extreme loveliness.
Warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress
And her loose hair; and where some heavy tress
The air of her own speed has disentwined,
The sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;
And in the soul a wild odour is felt,
Beyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt
Into the bosom of a frozen bud.—
See where she stands! a mortal shape indued
With love and life and light and deity,
And motion which may change but cannot die;
An image of some bright Eternity;
A shadow of some golden dream; a Splendour
Leaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender
Reflection of the eternal Moon of Love
Under whose motions life's dull billows move;
A Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning;
A Vision like incarnate April, warning,
With smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy
Into his summer grave.
Ah, woe is me!
What have I dared? where am I lifted? how
Shall I descend, and perish not? I know
That Love makes all things equal: I have heard
By mine own heart this joyous truth averred:
The spirit of the worm beneath the sod
In love and worship, blends itself with God.
Spouse! Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate
Whose course has been so starless! O too late
Belovèd! O too soon adored, by me!
For in the fields of Immortality
My spirit should at first have worshipped thine,
A divine presence in a place divine;
Or should have moved beside it on this earth,
A shadow of that substance, from its birth;
But not as now:—I love thee; yes, I feel
That on the fountain of my heart a seal
Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright
For thee, since in those tears thou hast delight.
We—are we not formed, as notes of music are,
For one another, though dissimilar;
Such difference without discord, as can make
Those sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake
As trembling leaves in a continuous air?
Thy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare
Beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.
I never was attached to that great sect,
Whose doctrine is, that each one should select
Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,
And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend
To cold oblivion, though it is in the code
Of modern morals, and the beaten road
Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,
Who travel to their home among the dead
By the broad highway of the world, and so
With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,
The dreariest and the longest journey go.
True Love in this differs from gold and clay,
That to divide is not to take away.
Love is like understanding, that grows bright,
Gazing on many truths; 'tis like thy light,
Imagination! which from earth and sky,
And from the depths of human fantasy,
As from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills
The Universe with glorious beams, and kills
Error, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow
Of its reverberated lightning. Narrow
The heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,
The life that wears, the spirit that creates
One object, and one form, and builds thereby
A sepulchre for its eternity.
Mind from its object differs most in this:
Evil from good; misery from happiness;
The baser from the nobler; the impure
And frail, from what is clear and must endure.
If you divide suffering and dross, you may
Diminish till it is consumed away;
If you divide pleasure and love and thought,
Each part exceeds the whole; and we know not
How much, while any yet remains unshared,
Of pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared:
This truth is that deep well, whence sages draw
The unenvied light of hope; the eternal law
By which those live, to whom this world of life
Is as a garden ravaged, and whose strife
Tills for the promise of a later birth
The wilderness of this Elysian earth.
There was a Being whom my spirit oft
Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,
In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,
Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,
Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves
Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves
Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor
Paved her light steps;—on an imagined shore,
Under the gray beak of some promontory
She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,
That I beheld her not. In solitudes
Her voice came to me through the whispering woods,
And from the fountains, and the odours deep
Of flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep
Of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,
Breathed but of her to the enamoured air;
And from the breezes whether low or loud,
And from the rain of every passing cloud,
And from the singing of the summer-birds,
And from all sounds, all silence. In the words
Of antique verse and high romance,—in form,
Sound, colour—in whatever checks that Storm
Which with the shattered present chokes the past;
And in that best philosophy, whose taste
Makes this cold common hell, our life, a doom
As glorious as a fiery martyrdom;
Her Spirit was the harmony of truth.—
Then, from the caverns of my dreamy youth
I sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,
And towards the lodestar of my one desire,
I flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight
Is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,
When it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere
A radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,
As if it were a lamp of earthly flame.—
But She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,
Passed, like a God throned on a wingèd planet,
Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,
Into the dreary cone of our life's shade;
And as a man with mighty loss dismayed,
I would have followed, though the grave between
Yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:
When a voice said:—‘O thou of hearts the weakest,
The phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.’
Then I—‘Where?’—the world's echo answered ‘where?’
And in that silence, and in my despair,
I questioned every tongueless wind that flew
Over my tower of mourning, if it knew
Whither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;
And murmured names and spells which have control
Over the sightless tyrants of our fate;
But neither prayer nor verse could dissipate
The night which closed on her; nor uncreate
That world within this Chaos, mine and me,
Of which she was the veiled Divinity,
The world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:
And therefore I went forth, with hope and fear
And every gentle passion sick to death,
Feeding my course with expectation's breath,
Into the wintry forest of our life;
And struggling through its error with vain strife,
And stumbling in my weakness and my haste,
And half bewildered by new forms, I passed,
Seeking among those untaught foresters
If I could find one form resembling hers,
In which she might have masked herself from me.
There,—One, whose voice was venomed melody
Sate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers;
The breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,
Her touch was as electric poison,—flame
Out of her looks into my vitals came,
And from her living cheeks and bosom flew
A killing air, which pierced like honey-dew
Into the core of my green heart, and lay
Upon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray
O'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime
With ruins of unseasonable time.
In many mortal forms I rashly sought
The shadow of that idol of my thought.
And some were fair—but beauty dies away:
Others were wise—but honeyed words betray:
And One was true—oh! why not true to me?
Then, as a hunted deer that could not flee,
I turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,
Wounded and weak and panting; the cold day
Trembled, for pity of my strife and pain.
When, like a noonday dawn, there shone again
Deliverance. One stood on my path who seemed
As like the glorious shape which I had dreamed
As is the Moon, whose changes ever run
Into themselves, to the eternal Sun;
The cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,
Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles,
That wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame
Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,
And warms not but illumines. Young and fair
As the descended Spirit of that sphere,
She hid me, as the Moon may hide the night
From its own darkness, until all was bright
Between the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,
And, as a cloud charioted by the wind,
She led me to a cave in that wild place,
And sate beside me, with her downward face
Illumining my slumbers, like the Moon
Waxing and waning o'er Endymion.
And I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,
And all my being became bright or dim
As the Moon's image in a summer sea,
According as she smiled or frowned on me;
And there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:
Alas, I then was nor alive nor dead:—
For at her silver voice came Death and Life,
Unmindful each of their accustomed strife,
Masked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,
The wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,
And through the cavern without wings they flew,
And cried ‘Away, he is not of our crew.’
I wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.
What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,
Blotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips
Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;—
And how my soul was as a lampless sea,
And who was then its Tempest; and when She,
The Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost
Crept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast
The moving billows of my being fell
Into a death of ice, immovable;—
And then—what earthquakes made it gape and split,
The white Moon smiling all the while on it,
These words conceal:—If not, each word would be
The key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!
At length, into the obscure Forest came
The Vision I had sought through grief and shame.
Athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns
Flashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,
And from her presence life was radiated
Through the gray earth and branches bare and dead;
So that her way was paved, and roofed above
With flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;
And music from her respiration spread
Like light,—all other sounds were penetrated
By the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,
So that the savage winds hung mute around;
And odours warm and fresh fell from her hair
Dissolving the dull cold in the frore air:
Soft as an Incarnation of the Sun,
When light is changed to love, this glorious One
Floated into the cavern where I lay,
And called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay
Was lifted by the thing that dreamed below
As smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow
I stood, and felt the dawn of my long night
Was penetrating me with living light:
I knew it was the Vision veiled from me
So many years—that it was Emily.
Twin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,
This world of love, this me; and into birth
Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart
Magnetic might into its central heart;
And lift its billows and its mists, and guide
By everlasting laws, each wind and tide
To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;
And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave
Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers
The armies of the rainbow-wingèd showers;
And, as those married lights, which from the towers
Of Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe
In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;
And all their many-mingled influence blend,
If equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;—
So ye, bright regents, with alternate sway
Govern my sphere of being, night and day!
Thou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;
Thou, not eclipsing a remoter light;
And, through the shadow of the seasons three,
From Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,
Light it into the Winter of the tomb,
Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.
Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,
Who drew the heart of this frail Universe
Towards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,
Alternating attraction and repulsion,
Thine went astray and that was rent in twain;
Oh, float into our azure heaven again!
Be there Love's folding-star at thy return;
The living Sun will feed thee from its urn
Of golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn
In thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn
Will worship thee with incense of calm breath
And lights and shadows; as the star of Death
And Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild
Called Hope and Fear—upon the heart are piled
Their offerings,—of this sacrifice divine
A World shall be the altar.
Lady mine,
Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth
Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth
Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,
Will be as of the trees of Paradise.
The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.
To whatsoe'er of dull mortality
Is mine, remain a vestal sister still;
To the intense, the deep, the imperishable,
Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united
Even as a bride, delighting and delighted.
The hour is come:—the destined Star has risen
Which shall descend upon a vacant prison.
The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set
The sentinels—but true Love never yet
Was thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:
Like lightning, with invisible violence
Piercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,
Which he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,
Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way
Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array
Of arms: more strength has Love than he or they;
For it can burst his charnel, and make free
The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,
The soul in dust and chaos.
Emily,
A ship is floating in the harbour now,
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;
There is a path on the sea's azure floor,
No keel has ever ploughed that path before;
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;
The merry mariners are bold and free:
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest
Is a far Eden of the purple East;
And we between her wings will sit, while Night,
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea,
Treading each other's heels, unheededly.
It is an isle under Ionian skies,
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,
And, for the harbours are not safe and good,
This land would have remained a solitude
But for some pastoral people native there,
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold.
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,
With ever-changing sound and light and foam,
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;
And all the winds wandering along the shore
Undulate with the undulating tide:
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;
And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,
As clear as elemental diamond,
Or serene morning air; and far beyond,
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)
Pierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls
Illumining, with sound that never fails
Accompany the noonday nightingales;
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs;
The light clear element which the isle wears
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers,
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep,
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain
Till you might faint with that delicious pain.
And every motion, odour, beam, and tone,
With that deep music is in unison:
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem
Like echoes of an antenatal dream.—
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,
Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,
Washed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.
It is a favoured place. Famine or Blight,
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they
Sail onward far upon their fatal way:
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,
From which its fields and woods ever renew
Their green and golden immortality.
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride
Glowing at once with love and loveliness,
Blushes and trembles at its own excess:
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,
An atom of th'Eternal, whose own smile
Unfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,
Filling their bare and void interstices.—
But the chief marvel of the wilderness
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how
None of the rustic island-people know:
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height
It overtops the woods; but, for delight,
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime
Had been invented, in the world's young prime,
Reared it, a wonder of that simple time,
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,
But, as it were Titanic; in the heart
Of Earth having assumed its form, then grown
Out of the mountains, from the living stone,
Lifting itself in caverns light and high:
For all the antique and learnèd imagery
Has been erased, and in the place of it
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit
The volumes of their many-twining stems;
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,
Or fragments of the day's intense serene;—
Working mosaic on their Parian floors.
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we
Read in their smiles, and call reality.
This isle and house are mine, and I have vowed
Thee to be lady of the solitude.—
And I have fitted up some chambers there
Looking towards the golden Eastern air,
And level with the living winds, which flow
Like waves above the living waves below.—
I have sent books and music there, and all
Those instruments with which high Spirits call
The future from its cradle, and the past
Out of its grave, and make the present last
In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,
Folded within their own eternity.
Our simple life wants little, and true taste
Hires not the pale drudge Luxury, to waste
The scene it would adorn, and therefore still,
Nature with all her children haunts the hill.
The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet
Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit
Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance
Between the quick bats in their twilight dance;
The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight
Before our gate, and the slow, silent night
Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.
Be this our home in life, and when years heap
Their withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,
Let us become the overhanging day,
The living soul of this Elysian isle,
Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile
We two will rise, and sit, and walk together,
Under the roof of blue Ionian weather,
And wander in the meadows, or ascend
The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend
With lightest winds, to touch their paramour;
Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore,
Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea
Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,—
Possessing and possessed by all that is
Within that calm circumference of bliss,
And by each other, till to love and live
Be one:—or, at the noontide hour, arrive
Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep
The moonlight of the expired night asleep,
Through which the awakened day can never peep;
A veil for our seclusion, close as night's,
Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;
Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain
Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again.
And we will talk, until thought's melody
Become too sweet for utterance, and it die
In words, to live again in looks, which dart
With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,
Harmonizing silence without a sound.
Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,
And our veins beat together; and our lips
With other eloquence than words, eclipse
The soul that burns between them, and the wells
Which boil under our being's inmost cells,
The fountains of our deepest life, shall be
Confused in Passion's golden purity,
As mountain-springs under the morning sun.
We shall become the same, we shall be one
Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?
One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,
Till like two meteors of expanding flame,
Those spheres instinct with it become the same,
Touch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still
Burning, yet ever inconsumable:
In one another's substance finding food,
Like flames too pure and light and unimbued
To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,
Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:
One hope within two wills, one will beneath
Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,
One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,
And one annihilation. Woe is me!
The wingèd words on which my soul would pierce
Into the height of Love's rare Universe,
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire—
I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!
Sweet Spirit! Sister of that orphan one,
Whose empire is the name thou weepest on,
In my heart's temple I suspend to thee
These votive wreaths of withered memory.
Poor captive bird! who, from thy narrow cage,
Pourest such music, that it might assuage
The ruggèd hearts of those who prisoned thee,
Were they not deaf to all sweet melody;
This song shall be thy rose: its petals pale
Are dead, indeed, my adored Nightingale!
But soft and fragrant is the faded blossom,
And it has no thorn left to wound thy bosom.
High, spirit-wingèd Heart! who dost for ever
Beat thine unfeeling bars with vain endeavour,
Till those bright plumes of thought, in which arrayed
It over-soared this low and worldly shade,
Lie shattered; and thy panting, wounded breast
Stains with dear blood its unmaternal nest!
I weep vain tears: blood would less bitter be,
Yet poured forth gladlier, could it profit thee.
Seraph of Heaven! too gentle to be human,
Veiling beneath that radiant form of Woman
All that is insupportable in thee
Of light, and love, and immortality!
Sweet Benediction in the eternal Curse!
Veiled Glory of this lampless Universe!
Thou Moon beyond the clouds! Thou living Form
Among the Dead! Thou Star above the Storm!
Thou Wonder, and thou Beauty, and thou Terror!
Thou Harmony of Nature's art! Thou Mirror
In whom, as in the splendour of the Sun,
All shapes look glorious which thou gazest on!
Ay, even the dim words which obscure thee now
Flash, lightning-like, with unaccustomed glow;
I pray thee that thou blot from this sad song
All of its much mortality and wrong,
With those clear drops, which start like sacred dew
From the twin lights thy sweet soul darkens through,
Weeping, till sorrow becomes ecstasy:
Then smile on it, so that it may not die.
I never thought before my death to see
Youth's vision thus made perfect. Emily,
I love thee; though the world by no thin name
Will hide that love from its unvalued shame.
Would we two had been twins of the same mother!
Or, that the name my heart lent to another
Could be a sister's bond for her and thee,
Blending two beams of one eternity!
Yet were one lawful and the other true,
These names, though dear, could paint not, as is due,
How beyond refuge I am thine. Ah me!
I am not thine: I am a part of thee.
Sweet Lamp! my moth-like Muse has burned its wings
Or, like a dying swan who soars and sings,
Young Love should teach Time, in his own gray style,
All that thou art. Art thou not void of guile,
A lovely soul formed to be blessed and bless?
A well of sealed and secret happiness,
Whose waters like blithe light and music are,
Vanquishing dissonance and gloom? A Star
Which moves not in the moving heavens, alone?
A Smile amid dark frowns? a gentle tone
Amid rude voices? a belovèd light?
A Solitude, a Refuge, a Delight?
A Lute, which those whom Love has taught to play
Make music on, to soothe the roughest day
And lull fond Grief asleep? a buried treasure?
A cradle of young thoughts of wingless pleasure?
A violet-shrouded grave of Woe?—I measure
The world of fancies, seeking one like thee,
And find—alas! mine own infirmity.
She met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,
And lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,
Winter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,
Led into light, life, peace. An antelope,
In the suspended impulse of its lightness,
Were less aethereally light: the brightness
Of her divinest presence trembles through
Her limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew
Embodied in the windless heaven of June
Amid the splendour-wingèd stars, the Moon
Burns, inextinguishably beautiful:
And from her lips, as from a hyacinth full
Of honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,
Killing the sense with passion; sweet as stops
Of planetary music heard in trance.
In her mild lights the starry spirits dance,
The sunbeams of those wells which ever leap
Under the lightnings of the soul—too deep
For the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.
The glory of her being, issuing thence,
Stains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade
Of unentangled intermixture, made
By Love, of light and motion: one intense
Diffusion, one serene Omnipresence,
Whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing,
Around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing
With the unintermitted blood, which there
Quivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air
The crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)
Continuously prolonged, and ending never,
Till they are lost, and in that Beauty furled
Which penetrates and clasps and fills the world;
Scarce visible from extreme loveliness.
Warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress
And her loose hair; and where some heavy tress
The air of her own speed has disentwined,
The sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind;
And in the soul a wild odour is felt,
Beyond the sense, like fiery dews that melt
Into the bosom of a frozen bud.—
See where she stands! a mortal shape indued
With love and life and light and deity,
And motion which may change but cannot die;
An image of some bright Eternity;
A shadow of some golden dream; a Splendour
Leaving the third sphere pilotless; a tender
Reflection of the eternal Moon of Love
Under whose motions life's dull billows move;
A Metaphor of Spring and Youth and Morning;
A Vision like incarnate April, warning,
With smiles and tears, Frost the Anatomy
Into his summer grave.
Ah, woe is me!
What have I dared? where am I lifted? how
Shall I descend, and perish not? I know
That Love makes all things equal: I have heard
By mine own heart this joyous truth averred:
The spirit of the worm beneath the sod
In love and worship, blends itself with God.
She met me, Stranger, upon life's rough way,
And lured me towards sweet Death; as Night by Day,
Winter by Spring, or Sorrow by swift Hope,
Led into light, life, peace. An antelope,
In the suspended impulse of its lightness,
Were less aethereally light: the brightness
Of her divinest presence trembles through
Her limbs, as underneath a cloud of dew
Embodied in the windless heaven of June
Amid the splendour-wingèd stars, the Moon
Burns, inextinguishably beautiful:
And from her lips, as from a hyacinth full
Of honey-dew, a liquid murmur drops,
Killing the sense with passion; sweet as stops
Of planetary music heard in trance.
In her mild lights the starry spirits dance,
The sunbeams of those wells which ever leap
Under the lightnings of the soul—too deep
For the brief fathom-line of thought or sense.

Stains the dead, blank, cold air with a warm shade
Of unentangled intermixture, made
By Love, of light and motion: one intense
Diffusion, one serene Omnipresence,

Around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing
With the unintermitted blood, which there
Quivers, (as in a fleece of snow-like air
The crimson pulse of living morning quiver,)
Continuously prolonged, and ending never,
Till they are lost, and in that Beauty furled
Which penetrates and clasps and fills the world;
Scarce visible from extreme loveliness.

And her loose hair; and where some heavy tress

And in the soul a wild odour is felt,

Ah, woe is me!
What have I dared? where am I lifted? how
Shall I descend, and perish not? I know
That Love makes all things equal: I have heard
By mine own heart this joyous truth averred:
The spirit of the worm beneath the sod
In love and worship, blends itself with God.
Spouse! Sister! Angel! Pilot of the Fate
Whose course has been so starless! O too late
Belovèd! O too soon adored, by me!
For in the fields of Immortality
My spirit should at first have worshipped thine,
A divine presence in a place divine;
Or should have moved beside it on this earth,
A shadow of that substance, from its birth;
But not as now:—I love thee; yes, I feel
That on the fountain of my heart a seal
Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright
For thee, since in those tears thou hast delight.
We—are we not formed, as notes of music are,
For one another, though dissimilar;
Such difference without discord, as can make
Those sweetest sounds, in which all spirits shake
As trembling leaves in a continuous air?
Thy wisdom speaks in me, and bids me dare
Beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked.
I never was attached to that great sect,
Whose doctrine is, that each one should select
Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend,
And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend
To cold oblivion, though it is in the code
Of modern morals, and the beaten road
Which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread,
Who travel to their home among the dead
By the broad highway of the world, and so
With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe,
The dreariest and the longest journey go.
True Love in this differs from gold and clay,
That to divide is not to take away.
Love is like understanding, that grows bright,
Gazing on many truths; 'tis like thy light,
Imagination! which from earth and sky,
And from the depths of human fantasy,
As from a thousand prisms and mirrors, fills
The Universe with glorious beams, and kills
Error, the worm, with many a sun-like arrow
Of its reverberated lightning. Narrow
The heart that loves, the brain that contemplates,
The life that wears, the spirit that creates
One object, and one form, and builds thereby
A sepulchre for its eternity.
Mind from its object differs most in this:
Evil from good; misery from happiness;
The baser from the nobler; the impure
And frail, from what is clear and must endure.
If you divide suffering and dross, you may
Diminish till it is consumed away;
If you divide pleasure and love and thought,
Each part exceeds the whole; and we know not
How much, while any yet remains unshared,
Of pleasure may be gained, of sorrow spared:
This truth is that deep well, whence sages draw
The unenvied light of hope; the eternal law
By which those live, to whom this world of life
Is as a garden ravaged, and whose strife
Tills for the promise of a later birth
The wilderness of this Elysian earth.
There was a Being whom my spirit oft
Met on its visioned wanderings, far aloft,
In the clear golden prime of my youth's dawn,
Upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn,
Amid the enchanted mountains, and the caves
Of divine sleep, and on the air-like waves
Of wonder-level dream, whose tremulous floor
Paved her light steps;—on an imagined shore,
Under the gray beak of some promontory
She met me, robed in such exceeding glory,
That I beheld her not. In solitudes
Her voice came to me through the whispering woods,
And from the fountains, and the odours deep
Of flowers, which, like lips murmuring in their sleep
Of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there,
Breathed but of her to the enamoured air;
And from the breezes whether low or loud,
And from the rain of every passing cloud,
And from the singing of the summer-birds,
And from all sounds, all silence. In the words
Of antique verse and high romance,—in form,
Sound, colour—in whatever checks that Storm
Which with the shattered present chokes the past;
And in that best philosophy, whose taste
Makes this cold common hell, our life, a doom
As glorious as a fiery martyrdom;
Her Spirit was the harmony of truth.—
Then, from the caverns of my dreamy youth
I sprang, as one sandalled with plumes of fire,
And towards the lodestar of my one desire,
I flitted, like a dizzy moth, whose flight
Is as a dead leaf's in the owlet light,
When it would seek in Hesper's setting sphere
A radiant death, a fiery sepulchre,
As if it were a lamp of earthly flame.—
But She, whom prayers or tears then could not tame,
Passed, like a God throned on a wingèd planet,
Whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it,
Into the dreary cone of our life's shade;
And as a man with mighty loss dismayed,
I would have followed, though the grave between
Yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen:
When a voice said:—‘O thou of hearts the weakest,
The phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest.’
Then I—‘Where?’—the world's echo answered ‘where?’
And in that silence, and in my despair,
I questioned every tongueless wind that flew
Over my tower of mourning, if it knew
Whither 'twas fled, this soul out of my soul;
And murmured names and spells which have control
Over the sightless tyrants of our fate;
But neither prayer nor verse could dissipate
The night which closed on her; nor uncreate
That world within this Chaos, mine and me,
Of which she was the veiled Divinity,
The world I say of thoughts that worshipped her:
And therefore I went forth, with hope and fear
And every gentle passion sick to death,
Feeding my course with expectation's breath,
Into the wintry forest of our life;
And struggling through its error with vain strife,
And stumbling in my weakness and my haste,
And half bewildered by new forms, I passed,
Seeking among those untaught foresters
If I could find one form resembling hers,
In which she might have masked herself from me.
There,—One, whose voice was venomed melody
Sate by a well, under blue nightshade bowers;
The breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers,
Her touch was as electric poison,—flame
Out of her looks into my vitals came,
And from her living cheeks and bosom flew
A killing air, which pierced like honey-dew
Into the core of my green heart, and lay
Upon its leaves; until, as hair grown gray
O'er a young brow, they hid its unblown prime
With ruins of unseasonable time.
In many mortal forms I rashly sought
The shadow of that idol of my thought.
And some were fair—but beauty dies away:
Others were wise—but honeyed words betray:
And One was true—oh! why not true to me?
Then, as a hunted deer that could not flee,
I turned upon my thoughts, and stood at bay,
Wounded and weak and panting; the cold day
Trembled, for pity of my strife and pain.
When, like a noonday dawn, there shone again
Deliverance. One stood on my path who seemed
As like the glorious shape which I had dreamed
As is the Moon, whose changes ever run
Into themselves, to the eternal Sun;
The cold chaste Moon, the Queen of Heaven's bright isles,
Who makes all beautiful on which she smiles,
That wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame
Which ever is transformed, yet still the same,
And warms not but illumines. Young and fair
As the descended Spirit of that sphere,
She hid me, as the Moon may hide the night
From its own darkness, until all was bright
Between the Heaven and Earth of my calm mind,
And, as a cloud charioted by the wind,
She led me to a cave in that wild place,
And sate beside me, with her downward face
Illumining my slumbers, like the Moon
Waxing and waning o'er Endymion.
And I was laid asleep, spirit and limb,
And all my being became bright or dim
As the Moon's image in a summer sea,
According as she smiled or frowned on me;
And there I lay, within a chaste cold bed:
Alas, I then was nor alive nor dead:—
For at her silver voice came Death and Life,
Unmindful each of their accustomed strife,
Masked like twin babes, a sister and a brother,
The wandering hopes of one abandoned mother,
And through the cavern without wings they flew,
And cried ‘Away, he is not of our crew.’
I wept, and though it be a dream, I weep.
What storms then shook the ocean of my sleep,
Blotting that Moon, whose pale and waning lips
Then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse;—
And how my soul was as a lampless sea,
And who was then its Tempest; and when She,
The Planet of that hour, was quenched, what frost
Crept o'er those waters, till from coast to coast
The moving billows of my being fell
Into a death of ice, immovable;—
And then—what earthquakes made it gape and split,
The white Moon smiling all the while on it,
These words conceal:—If not, each word would be
The key of staunchless tears. Weep not for me!
At length, into the obscure Forest came
The Vision I had sought through grief and shame.
Athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns
Flashed from her motion splendour like the Morn's,
And from her presence life was radiated
Through the gray earth and branches bare and dead;
So that her way was paved, and roofed above
With flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love;
And music from her respiration spread
Like light,—all other sounds were penetrated
By the small, still, sweet spirit of that sound,
So that the savage winds hung mute around;
And odours warm and fresh fell from her hair
Dissolving the dull cold in the frore air:
Soft as an Incarnation of the Sun,
When light is changed to love, this glorious One
Floated into the cavern where I lay,
And called my Spirit, and the dreaming clay
Was lifted by the thing that dreamed below
As smoke by fire, and in her beauty's glow
I stood, and felt the dawn of my long night
Was penetrating me with living light:
I knew it was the Vision veiled from me
So many years—that it was Emily.
Twin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,
This world of love, this me; and into birth
Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart
Magnetic might into its central heart;
And lift its billows and its mists, and guide
By everlasting laws, each wind and tide
To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;
And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave
Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers
The armies of the rainbow-wingèd showers;
And, as those married lights, which from the towers
Of Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe
In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;
And all their many-mingled influence blend,
If equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;—
So ye, bright regents, with alternate sway
Govern my sphere of being, night and day!
Thou, not disdaining even a borrowed might;
Thou, not eclipsing a remoter light;
And, through the shadow of the seasons three,
From Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,
Light it into the Winter of the tomb,
Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.
Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,
Who drew the heart of this frail Universe
Towards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,
Alternating attraction and repulsion,
Thine went astray and that was rent in twain;
Oh, float into our azure heaven again!
Be there Love's folding-star at thy return;
The living Sun will feed thee from its urn
Of golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn
In thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn
Will worship thee with incense of calm breath
And lights and shadows; as the star of Death
And Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild
Called Hope and Fear—upon the heart are piled
Their offerings,—of this sacrifice divine
A World shall be the altar.
Lady mine,
Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth
Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth
Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,
Will be as of the trees of Paradise.
Twin Spheres of light who rule this passive Earth,
This world of love, this me; and into birth
Awaken all its fruits and flowers, and dart
Magnetic might into its central heart;
And lift its billows and its mists, and guide
By everlasting laws, each wind and tide
To its fit cloud, and its appointed cave;
And lull its storms, each in the craggy grave
Which was its cradle, luring to faint bowers
The armies of the rainbow-wingèd showers;
And, as those married lights, which from the towers
Of Heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe
In liquid sleep and splendour, as a robe;
And all their many-mingled influence blend,
If equal, yet unlike, to one sweet end;—

And, through the shadow of the seasons three,
From Spring to Autumn's sere maturity,
Light it into the Winter of the tomb,
Where it may ripen to a brighter bloom.
Thou too, O Comet beautiful and fierce,
Who drew the heart of this frail Universe
Towards thine own; till, wrecked in that convulsion,
Alternating attraction and repulsion,
Thine went astray and that was rent in twain;
Oh, float into our azure heaven again!
Be there Love's folding-star at thy return;
The living Sun will feed thee from its urn
Of golden fire; the Moon will veil her horn
In thy last smiles; adoring Even and Morn
Will worship thee with incense of calm breath
And lights and shadows; as the star of Death
And Birth is worshipped by those sisters wild
Called Hope and Fear—upon the heart are piled
Their offerings,—of this sacrifice divine
A World shall be the altar.
Lady mine,
Scorn not these flowers of thought, the fading birth
Which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth
Whose fruit, made perfect by thy sunny eyes,
Will be as of the trees of Paradise.
The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.
To whatsoe'er of dull mortality
Is mine, remain a vestal sister still;
To the intense, the deep, the imperishable,
Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united
Even as a bride, delighting and delighted.
The hour is come:—the destined Star has risen
Which shall descend upon a vacant prison.
The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set
The sentinels—but true Love never yet
Was thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:
Like lightning, with invisible violence
Piercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,
Which he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,
Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way
Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array
Of arms: more strength has Love than he or they;
For it can burst his charnel, and make free
The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,
The soul in dust and chaos.
Emily,
A ship is floating in the harbour now,
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;
There is a path on the sea's azure floor,
No keel has ever ploughed that path before;
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;
The merry mariners are bold and free:
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest
Is a far Eden of the purple East;
And we between her wings will sit, while Night,
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea,
Treading each other's heels, unheededly.
It is an isle under Ionian skies,
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,
And, for the harbours are not safe and good,
This land would have remained a solitude
But for some pastoral people native there,
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold.
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,
With ever-changing sound and light and foam,
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;
And all the winds wandering along the shore
Undulate with the undulating tide:
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;
And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,
As clear as elemental diamond,
Or serene morning air; and far beyond,
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)
Pierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls
Illumining, with sound that never fails
Accompany the noonday nightingales;
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs;
The light clear element which the isle wears
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers,
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep,
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain
Till you might faint with that delicious pain.
And every motion, odour, beam, and tone,
With that deep music is in unison:
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem
Like echoes of an antenatal dream.—
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,
Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,
Washed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.
It is a favoured place. Famine or Blight,
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they
Sail onward far upon their fatal way:
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,
From which its fields and woods ever renew
Their green and golden immortality.
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride
Glowing at once with love and loveliness,
Blushes and trembles at its own excess:
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,
An atom of th'Eternal, whose own smile
Unfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,
Filling their bare and void interstices.—
But the chief marvel of the wilderness
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how
None of the rustic island-people know:
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height
It overtops the woods; but, for delight,
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime
Had been invented, in the world's young prime,
Reared it, a wonder of that simple time,
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,
But, as it were Titanic; in the heart
Of Earth having assumed its form, then grown
Out of the mountains, from the living stone,
Lifting itself in caverns light and high:
For all the antique and learnèd imagery
Has been erased, and in the place of it
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit
The volumes of their many-twining stems;
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,
Or fragments of the day's intense serene;—
Working mosaic on their Parian floors.
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we
Read in their smiles, and call reality.
The day is come, and thou wilt fly with me.
To whatsoe'er of dull mortality
Is mine, remain a vestal sister still;
To the intense, the deep, the imperishable,
Not mine but me, henceforth be thou united
Even as a bride, delighting and delighted.
The hour is come:—the destined Star has risen
Which shall descend upon a vacant prison.
The walls are high, the gates are strong, thick set
The sentinels—but true Love never yet
Was thus constrained: it overleaps all fence:
Like lightning, with invisible violence
Piercing its continents; like Heaven's free breath,
Which he who grasps can hold not; liker Death,
Who rides upon a thought, and makes his way
Through temple, tower, and palace, and the array
Of arms: more strength has Love than he or they;
For it can burst his charnel, and make free
The limbs in chains, the heart in agony,
The soul in dust and chaos.
Emily,
A ship is floating in the harbour now,
A wind is hovering o'er the mountain's brow;
There is a path on the sea's azure floor,
No keel has ever ploughed that path before;
The halcyons brood around the foamless isles;
The treacherous Ocean has forsworn its wiles;
The merry mariners are bold and free:
Say, my heart's sister, wilt thou sail with me?
Our bark is as an albatross, whose nest
Is a far Eden of the purple East;
And we between her wings will sit, while Night,
And Day, and Storm, and Calm, pursue their flight,
Our ministers, along the boundless Sea,
Treading each other's heels, unheededly.
It is an isle under Ionian skies,
Beautiful as a wreck of Paradise,
And, for the harbours are not safe and good,
This land would have remained a solitude
But for some pastoral people native there,
Who from the Elysian, clear, and golden air
Draw the last spirit of the age of gold,
Simple and spirited; innocent and bold.
The blue Aegean girds this chosen home,
With ever-changing sound and light and foam,
Kissing the sifted sands, and caverns hoar;
And all the winds wandering along the shore
Undulate with the undulating tide:
There are thick woods where sylvan forms abide;
And many a fountain, rivulet, and pond,
As clear as elemental diamond,
Or serene morning air; and far beyond,
The mossy tracks made by the goats and deer
(Which the rough shepherd treads but once a year)
Pierce into glades, caverns, and bowers, and halls
Built round with ivy, which the waterfalls
Illumining, with sound that never fails
Accompany the noonday nightingales;
And all the place is peopled with sweet airs;
The light clear element which the isle wears
Is heavy with the scent of lemon-flowers,
Which floats like mist laden with unseen showers,
And falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep;
And from the moss violets and jonquils peep,
And dart their arrowy odour through the brain
Till you might faint with that delicious pain.
And every motion, odour, beam, and tone,
With that deep music is in unison:
Which is a soul within the soul—they seem
Like echoes of an antenatal dream.—
It is an isle 'twixt Heaven, Air, Earth, and Sea,
Cradled, and hung in clear tranquillity;
Bright as that wandering Eden Lucifer,
Washed by the soft blue Oceans of young air.
It is a favoured place. Famine or Blight,
Pestilence, War and Earthquake, never light
Upon its mountain-peaks; blind vultures, they
Sail onward far upon their fatal way:
The wingèd storms, chanting their thunder-psalm
To other lands, leave azure chasms of calm
Over this isle, or weep themselves in dew,
From which its fields and woods ever renew
Their green and golden immortality.
And from the sea there rise, and from the sky
There fall, clear exhalations, soft and bright,
Veil after veil, each hiding some delight,
Which Sun or Moon or zephyr draw aside,
Till the isle's beauty, like a naked bride
Glowing at once with love and loveliness,
Blushes and trembles at its own excess:
Yet, like a buried lamp, a Soul no less
Burns in the heart of this delicious isle,
An atom of th'Eternal, whose own smile
Unfolds itself, and may be felt, not seen
O'er the gray rocks, blue waves, and forests green,
Filling their bare and void interstices.—
But the chief marvel of the wilderness
Is a lone dwelling, built by whom or how
None of the rustic island-people know:
'Tis not a tower of strength, though with its height
It overtops the woods; but, for delight,
Some wise and tender Ocean-King, ere crime
Had been invented, in the world's young prime,
Reared it, a wonder of that simple time,
An envy of the isles, a pleasure-house
Made sacred to his sister and his spouse.
It scarce seems now a wreck of human art,
But, as it were Titanic; in the heart
Of Earth having assumed its form, then grown
Out of the mountains, from the living stone,
Lifting itself in caverns light and high:
For all the antique and learnèd imagery
Has been erased, and in the place of it
The ivy and the wild-vine interknit
The volumes of their many-twining stems;
Parasite flowers illume with dewy gems
The lampless halls, and when they fade, the sky
Peeps through their winter-woof of tracery
With moonlight patches, or star atoms keen,
Or fragments of the day's intense serene;—
Working mosaic on their Parian floors.
And, day and night, aloof, from the high towers
And terraces, the Earth and Ocean seem
To sleep in one another's arms, and dream
Of waves, flowers, clouds, woods, rocks, and all that we
Read in their smiles, and call reality.
This isle and house are mine, and I have vowed
Thee to be lady of the solitude.—
And I have fitted up some chambers there
Looking towards the golden Eastern air,
And level with the living winds, which flow
Like waves above the living waves below.—
I have sent books and music there, and all
Those instruments with which high Spirits call
The future from its cradle, and the past
Out of its grave, and make the present last
In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die,
Folded within their own eternity.
Our simple life wants little, and true taste
Hires not the pale drudge Luxury, to waste
The scene it would adorn, and therefore still,
Nature with all her children haunts the hill.
The ring-dove, in the embowering ivy, yet
Keeps up her love-lament, and the owls flit
Round the evening tower, and the young stars glance
Between the quick bats in their twilight dance;
The spotted deer bask in the fresh moonlight
Before our gate, and the slow, silent night
Is measured by the pants of their calm sleep.
Be this our home in life, and when years heap
Their withered hours, like leaves, on our decay,
Let us become the overhanging day,
The living soul of this Elysian isle,
Conscious, inseparable, one. Meanwhile
We two will rise, and sit, and walk together,
Under the roof of blue Ionian weather,
And wander in the meadows, or ascend
The mossy mountains, where the blue heavens bend
With lightest winds, to touch their paramour;
Or linger, where the pebble-paven shore,
Under the quick, faint kisses of the sea
Trembles and sparkles as with ecstasy,—
Possessing and possessed by all that is
Within that calm circumference of bliss,
And by each other, till to love and live
Be one:—or, at the noontide hour, arrive
Where some old cavern hoar seems yet to keep
The moonlight of the expired night asleep,
Through which the awakened day can never peep;
A veil for our seclusion, close as night's,
Where secure sleep may kill thine innocent lights;
Sleep, the fresh dew of languid love, the rain
Whose drops quench kisses till they burn again.
And we will talk, until thought's melody
Become too sweet for utterance, and it die
In words, to live again in looks, which dart
With thrilling tone into the voiceless heart,
Harmonizing silence without a sound.
Our breath shall intermix, our bosoms bound,
And our veins beat together; and our lips
With other eloquence than words, eclipse
The soul that burns between them, and the wells
Which boil under our being's inmost cells,
The fountains of our deepest life, shall be
Confused in Passion's golden purity,
As mountain-springs under the morning sun.
We shall become the same, we shall be one
Spirit within two frames, oh! wherefore two?
One passion in twin-hearts, which grows and grew,
Till like two meteors of expanding flame,
Those spheres instinct with it become the same,
Touch, mingle, are transfigured; ever still
Burning, yet ever inconsumable:
In one another's substance finding food,
Like flames too pure and light and unimbued
To nourish their bright lives with baser prey,
Which point to Heaven and cannot pass away:
One hope within two wills, one will beneath
Two overshadowing minds, one life, one death,
One Heaven, one Hell, one immortality,
And one annihilation. Woe is me!
The wingèd words on which my soul would pierce
Into the height of Love's rare Universe,
Are chains of lead around its flight of fire—
I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire!
Weak Verses, go, kneel at your Sovereign's feet,
And say:—‘We are the masters of thy slave;
What wouldest thou with us and ours and thine?”
Then call your sisters from Oblivion's cave,
All singing loud: ‘Love's very pain is sweet,
But its reward is in the world divine
Which, if not here, it builds beyond the grave.’
So shall ye live when I am there. Then haste
Over the hearts of men, until ye meet
Marina, Vanna, Primus, and the rest,
And bid them love each other and be blessed:
And leave the troop which errs, and which reproves,
And come and be my guest,—for I am Love's.



    I weep for Adonais—he is dead!
    O, weep for Adonais! though our tears
    Thaw not the frost which binds so dear a head!
    And thou, sad Hour, selected from all years
    To mourn our loss, rouse thy obscure compeers,
    And teach them thine own sorrow, say: ‘With me
    Died Adonais; till the Future dares
    Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
An echo and a light unto eternity!’
    Where wert thou, mighty Mother, when he lay,
    When thy Son lay, pierced by the shaft which flies
    In darkness? where was lorn Urania
    When Adonais died? With veilèd eyes,
    'Mid listening Echoes, in her Paradise
    She sate, while one, with soft enamoured breath,
    Rekindled all the fading melodies,
    With which, like flowers that mock the corse beneath,
He had adorned and hid the coming bulk of Death.
    Oh, weep for Adonais—he is dead!
    Wake, melancholy Mother, wake and weep!
    Yet wherefore? Quench within their burning bed
    Thy fiery tears, and let thy loud heart keep
    Like his, a mute and uncomplaining sleep;
    For he is gone, where all things wise and fair
    Descend;—oh, dream not that the amorous Deep
    Will yet restore him to the vital air;
Death feeds on his mute voice, and laughs at our despair.
    Most musical of mourners, weep again!
    Lament anew, Urania!—He died,
    Who was the Sire of an immortal strain,
    Blind, old, and lonely, when his country's pride,
    The priest, the slave, and the liberticide,
    Trampled and mocked with many a loathèd rite
    Of lust and blood; he went, unterrified,
    Into the gulf of death; but his clear Sprite
Yet reigns o'er earth; the third among the sons of light.
    Most musical of mourners, weep anew!
    Not all to that bright station dared to climb;
    And happier they their happiness who knew,
    Whose tapers yet burn through that night of time
    In which suns perished; others more sublime,
    Struck by the envious wrath of man or god,
    Have sunk, extinct in their refulgent prime;
    And some yet live, treading the thorny road,
Which leads, through toil and hate, to Fame's serene abode.
    But now, thy youngest, dearest one, has perished—
    The nursling of thy widowhood, who grew,
    Like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherished,
    And fed with true-love tears, instead of dew;
    Most musical of mourners, weep anew!
    Thy extreme hope, the loveliest and the last.
    The bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew
    Died on the promise of the fruit, is waste;
The broken lily lies—the storm is overpast.
    To that high Capital, where kingly Death
    Keeps his pale court in beauty and decay,
    He came; and bought, with price of purest breath,
    A grave among the eternal.—Come away!
    Haste, while the vault of blue Italian day
    Is yet his fitting charnel-roof! while still
    He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;
    Awake him not! surely he takes his fill
Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill.
    He will awake no more, oh, never more!—
    Within the twilight chamber spreads apace
    The shadow of white Death, and at the door
    Invisible Corruption waits to trace
    His extreme way to her dim dwelling-place;
    The eternal Hunger sits, but pity and awe
    Soothe her pale rage, nor dares she to deface
    So fair a prey, till darkness, and the law
Of change, shall o'er his sleep the mortal curtain draw.
    Oh, weep for Adonais!—The quick Dreams,
    The passion-wingèd Ministers of thought,
    Who were his flocks, whom near the living streams
    Of his young spirit he fed, and whom he taught
    The love which was its music, wander not,—
    Wander no more, from kindling brain to brain,
    But droop there, whence they sprung; and mourn their lot
    Round the cold heart, where, after their sweet pain,
They ne'er will gather strength, or find a home again.
    And one with trembling hands clasps his cold head,
    And fans him with her moonlight wings, and cries;
    ‘Our love, our hope, our sorrow, is not dead;
    See, on the silken fringe of his faint eyes,
    Like dew upon a sleeping flower, there lies
    A tear some Dream has loosened from his brain.’
    Lost Angel of a ruined Paradise!
    She knew not 'twas her own; as with no stain
She faded, like a cloud which had outwept its rain.
    One from a lucid urn of starry dew
    Washed his light limbs as if embalming them;
    Another clipped her profuse locks, and threw
    The wreath upon him, like an anadem,
    Which frozen tears instead of pearls begem;
    Another in her wilful grief would break
    Her bow and wingèd reeds, as if to stem
    A greater loss with one which was more weak;
And dull the barbèd fire against his frozen cheek.
    Another Splendour on his mouth alit,
    That mouth, whence it was wont to draw the breath
    Which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit,
    And pass into the panting heart beneath
    With lightning and with music: the damp death
    Quenched its caress upon his icy lips;
    And, as a dying meteor stains a wreath
    Of moonlight vapour, which the cold night clips,
It flushed through his pale limbs, and passed to its eclipse.
    And others came . . . Desires and Adorations,
    Wingèd Persuasions and veiled Destinies,
    Splendours, and Glooms, and glimmering Incarnations
    Of hopes and fears, and twilight Phantasies;
    And Sorrow, with her family of Sighs,
    And Pleasure, blind with tears, led by the gleam
    Of her own dying smile instead of eyes,
    Came in slow pomp;—the moving pomp might seem
Like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream.
    All he had loved, and moulded into thought,
    From shape, and hue, and odour, and sweet sound,
    Lamented Adonais. Morning sought
    Her eastern watch-tower, and her hair unbound,
    Wet with the tears which should adorn the ground,
    Dimmed the aëreal eyes that kindle day;
    Afar the melancholy thunder moaned,
    Pale Ocean in unquiet slumber lay,
And the wild Winds flew round, sobbing in their dismay.
    Lost Echo sits amid the voiceless mountains,
    And feeds her grief with his remembered lay,
    And will no more reply to winds or fountains,
    Or amorous birds perched on the young green spray,
    Or herdsman's horn, or bell at closing day;
    Since she can mimic not his lips, more dear
    Than those for whose disdain she pined away
    Into a shadow of all sounds:—a drear
Murmur, between their songs, is all the woodmen hear.
    Grief made the young Spring wild, and she threw down
    Her kindling buds, as if she Autumn were,
    Or they dead leaves; since her delight is flown,
    For whom should she have waked the sullen year?
    To Phoebus was not Hyacinth so dear
    Nor to himself Narcissus, as to both
    Thou, Adonais: wan they stand and sere
    Amid the faint companions of their youth,
With dew all turned to tears; odour, to sighing ruth.
    Thy spirit's sister, the lorn nightingale
    Mourns not her mate with such melodious pain;
    Not so the eagle, who like thee could scale
    Heaven, and could nourish in the sun's domain
    Her mighty youth with morning, doth complain,
    Soaring and screaming round her empty nest,
    As Albion wails for thee: the curse of Cain
    Light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast,
And scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest!
    Ah, woe is me! Winter is come and gone,
    But grief returns with the revolving year;
    The airs and streams renew their joyous tone;
    The ants, the bees, the swallows reappear;
    Fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead Seasons' bier;
    The amorous birds now pair in every brake,
    And build their mossy homes in field and brere;
    And the green lizard, and the golden snake,
Like unimprisoned flames, out of their trance awake.
    Through wood and stream and field and hill and Ocean
    A quickening life from the Earth's heart has burst
    As it has ever done, with change and motion,
    From the great morning of the world when first
    God dawned on Chaos; in its stream immersed,
    The lamps of Heaven flash with a softer light;
    All baser things pant with life's sacred thirst;
    Diffuse themselves; and spend in love's delight,
The beauty and the joy of their renewèd might.
    The leprous corpse, touched by this spirit tender,
    Exhales itself in flowers of gentle breath;
    Like incarnations of the stars, when splendour
    Is changed to fragrance, they illumine death
    And mock the merry worm that wakes beneath;
    Nought we know, dies. Shall that alone which knows
    Be as a sword consumed before the sheath
    By sightless lightning?—the intense atom glows
A moment, then is quenched in a most cold repose.
    Alas! that all we loved of him should be,
    But for our grief, as if it had not been,
    And grief itself be mortal! Woe is me!
    Whence are we, and why are we? of what scene
    The actors or spectators? Great and mean
    Meet massed in death, who lends what life must borrow.
    As long as skies are blue, and fields are green,
    Evening must usher night, night urge the morrow,
Month follow month with woe, and year wake year to sorrow.
    He will awake no more, oh, never more!
    ‘Wake thou,’ cried Misery, ‘childless Mother, rise
    Out of thy sleep, and slake, in thy heart's core,
    A wound more fierce than his, with tears and sighs.’
    And all the Dreams that watched Urania's eyes,
    And all the Echoes whom their sister's song
    Had held in holy silence, cried: ‘Arise!’
    Swift as a Thought by the snake Memory stung,
From her ambrosial rest the fading Splendour sprung.
    She rose like an autumnal Night, that springs
    Out of the East, and follows wild and drear
    The golden Day, which, on eternal wings,
    Even as a ghost abandoning a bier,
    Had left the Earth a corpse. Sorrow and fear
    So struck, so roused, so rapped Urania;
    So saddened round her like an atmosphere
    Of stormy mist; so swept her on her way
Even to the mournful place where Adonais lay.
    Out of her secret Paradise she sped,
    Through camps and cities rough with stone, and steel,
    And human hearts, which to her aery tread
    Yielding not, wounded the invisible
    Palms of her tender feet where'er they fell:
    And barbèd tongues, and thoughts more sharp than they,
    Rent the soft Form they never could repel,
    Whose sacred blood, like the young tears of May,
Paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way.
    In the death-chamber for a moment Death,
    Shamed by the presence of that living Might,
    Blushed to annihilation, and the breath
    Revisited those lips, and Life's pale light
    Flashed through those limbs, so late her dear delight.
    ‘Leave me not wild and drear and comfortless,
    As silent lightning leaves the starless night!
    Leave me not!’ cried Urania: her distress
Roused Death: Death rose and smiled, and met her vain caress.
    ‘Stay yet awhile! speak to me once again;
    Kiss me, so long but as a kiss may live;
    And in my heartless breast and burning brain
    That word, that kiss, shall all thoughts else survive,
    With food of saddest memory kept alive,
    Now thou art dead, as if it were a part
    Of thee, my Adonais! I would give
    All that I am to be as thou now art!
But I am chained to Time, and cannot thence depart!
    ‘O gentle child, beautiful as thou wert,
    Why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men
    Too soon, and with weak hands though mighty heart
    Dare the unpastured dragon in his den?
    Defenceless as thou wert, oh, where was then
    Wisdom the mirrored shield, or scorn the spear?
    Or hadst thou waited the full cycle, when
    Thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere,
The monsters of life's waste had fled from thee like deer.
    ‘The herded wolves, bold only to pursue;
    The obscene ravens, clamorous o'er the dead;
    The vultures to the conqueror's banner true
    Who feed where Desolation first has fed,
    And whose wings rain contagion;—how they fled,
    When, like Apollo, from his golden bow
    The Pythian of the age one arrow sped
    And smiled!—The spoilers tempt no second blow,
They fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low.
    ‘The sun comes forth, and many reptiles spawn;
    He sets, and each ephemeral insect then
    Is gathered into death without a dawn,
    And the immortal stars awake again;
    So is it in the world of living men:
    A godlike mind soars forth, in its delight
    Making earth bare and veiling heaven, and when
    It sinks, the swarms that dimmed or shared its light
Leave to its kindred lamps the spirit's awful night.’
    Thus ceased she: and the mountain shepherds came,
    Their garlands sere, their magic mantles rent;
    The Pilgrim of Eternity, whose fame
    Over his living head like Heaven is bent,
    An early but enduring monument,
    Came, veiling all the lightnings of his song
    In sorrow; from her wilds Ierne sent
    The sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong,
And Love taught Grief to fall like music from his tongue.
    Midst others of less note, came one frail Form,
    A phantom among men; companionless
    As the last cloud of an expiring storm
    Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,
    Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,
    Actaeon-like, and now he fled astray
    With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness,
    And his own thoughts, along that rugged way,
Pursued, like raging hounds, their father and their prey.
    A pardlike Spirit beautiful and swift—
    A Love in desolation masked;—a Power
    Girt round with weakness;—it can scarce uplift
    The weight of the superincumbent hour;
    It is a dying lamp, a falling shower,
    A breaking billow;—even whilst we speak
    Is it not broken? On the withering flower
    The killing sun smiles brightly: on a cheek
The life can burn in blood, even while the heart may break.
    His head was bound with pansies overblown,
    And faded violets, white, and pied, and blue;
    And a light spear topped with a cypress cone,
    Round whose rude shaft dark ivy-tresses grew
    Yet dripping with the forest's noonday dew,
    Vibrated, as the ever-beating heart
    Shook the weak hand that grasped it; of that crew
    He came the last, neglected and apart;
A herd-abandoned deer struck by the hunter's dart.
    All stood aloof, and at his partial moan
    Smiled through their tears; well knew that gentle band
    Who in another's fate now wept his own,
    As in the accents of an unknown land
    He sung new sorrow; sad Urania scanned
    The Stranger's mien, and murmured: ‘Who art thou?’
    He answered not, but with a sudden hand
    Made bare his branded and ensanguined brow,
Which was like Cain's or Christ's—oh! that it should be so!
    What softer voice is hushed over the dead?
    Athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown?
    What form leans sadly o'er the white death-bed,
    In mockery of monumental stone,
    The heavy heart heaving without a moan?
    If it be He, who, gentlest of the wise,
    Taught, soothed, loved, honoured the departed one,
    Let me not vex, with inharmonious sighs,
The silence of that heart's accepted sacrifice.
    Our Adonais has drunk poison—oh!
    What deaf and viperous murderer could crown
    Life's early cup with such a draught of woe?
    The nameless worm would now itself disown:
    It felt, yet could escape, the magic tone
    Whose prelude held all envy, hate, and wrong,
    But what was howling in one breast alone,
    Silent with expectation of the song,
Whose master's hand is cold, whose silver lyre unstrung.
    Live thou, whose infamy is not thy fame!
    Live! fear no heavier chastisement from me,
    Thou noteless blot on a remembered name!
    But be thyself, and know thyself to be!
    And ever at thy season be thou free
    To spill the venom when thy fangs o'erflow:
    Remorse and Self-contempt shall cling to thee;
    Hot Shame shall burn upon thy secret brow,
And like a beaten hound tremble thou shalt—as now.
    Nor let us weep that our delight is fled
    Far from these carrion kites that scream below;
    He wakes or sleeps with the enduring dead;
    Thou canst not soar where he is sitting now.
    Dust to the dust! but the pure spirit shall flow
    Back to the burning fountain whence it came,
    A portion of the Eternal, which must glow
    Through time and change, unquenchably the same,
Whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame.
    Peace, peace! he is not dead, he doth not sleep—
    He hath awakened from the dream of life—
    'Tis we, who lost in stormy visions, keep
    With phantoms an unprofitable strife,
    And in mad trance, strike with our spirit's knife
    Invulnerable nothings.—We decay
    Like corpses in a charnel; fear and grief
    Convulse us and consume us day by day,
And cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay.
    He has outsoared the shadow of our night;
    Envy and calumny and hate and pain,
    And that unrest which men miscall delight,
    Can touch him not and torture not again;
    From the contagion of the world's slow stain
    He is secure, and now can never mourn
    A heart grown cold, a head grown gray in vain;
    Nor, when the spirit's self has ceased to burn,
With sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn.
    He lives, he wakes—'tis Death is dead, not he;
    Mourn not for Adonais.—Thou young Dawn,
    Turn all thy dew to splendour, for from thee
    The spirit thou lamentest is not gone;
    Ye caverns and ye forests, cease to moan!
    Cease, ye faint flowers and fountains, and thou Air,
    Which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown
    O'er the abandoned Earth, now leave it bare
Even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair!
    He is made one with Nature: there is heard
    His voice in all her music, from the moan
    Of thunder, to the song of night's sweet bird;
    He is a presence to be felt and known
    In darkness and in light, from herb and stone,
    Spreading itself where'er that Power may move
    Which has withdrawn his being to its own;
    Which wields the world with never-wearied love,
Sustains it from beneath, and kindles it above.
    He is a portion of the loveliness
    Which once he made more lovely: he doth bear
    His part, while the one Spirit's plastic stress
    Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there,
    All new successions to the forms they wear;
    Torturing th'unwilling dross that checks its flight
    To its own likeness, as each mass may bear;
    And bursting in its beauty and its might
From trees and beasts and men into the Heaven's light.
    The splendours of the firmament of time
    May be eclipsed, but are extinguished not;
    Like stars to their appointed height they climb,
    And death is a low mist which cannot blot
    The brightness it may veil. When lofty thought
    Lifts a young heart above its mortal lair,
    And love and life contend in it, for what
    Shall be its earthly doom, the dead live there
And move like winds of light on dark and stormy air.
    The inheritors of unfulfilled renown
    Rose from their thrones, built beyond mortal thought,
    Far in the Unapparent. Chatterton
    Rose pale,—his solemn agony had not
    Yet faded from him; Sidney, as he fought
    And as he fell and as he lived and loved
    Sublimely mild, a Spirit without spot,
    Arose; and Lucan, by his death approved:
Oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved.
    And many more, whose names on Earth are dark,
    But whose transmitted effluence cannot die
    So long as fire outlives the parent spark,
    Rose, robed in dazzling immortality.
    ‘Thou art become as one of us,’ they cry,
    ‘It was for thee yon kingless sphere has long
    Swung blind in unascended majesty,
    Silent alone amid an Heaven of Song.
Assume thy wingèd throne, thou Vesper of our throng!’
    Who mourns for Adonais? Oh, come forth,
    Fond wretch! and know thyself and him aright.
    Clasp with thy panting soul the pendulous Earth;
    As from a centre, dart thy spirit's light
    Beyond all worlds, until its spacious might
    Satiate the void circumference: then shrink
    Even to a point within our day and night;
    And keep thy heart light lest it make thee sink
When hope has kindled hope, and lured thee to the brink.
    Or go to Rome, which is the sepulchre,
    Oh, not of him, but of our joy: 'tis nought
    That ages, empires, and religions there
    Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;
    For such as he can lend,—they borrow not
    Glory from those who made the world their prey;
    And he is gathered to the kings of thought
    Who waged contention with their time's decay,
And of the past are all that cannot pass away.
    Go thou to Rome,—at once the Paradise,
    The grave, the city, and the wilderness;
    And where its wrecks like shattered mountains rise,
    And flowering weeds, and fragrant copses dress
    The bones of Desolation's nakedness
    Pass, till the spirit of the spot shall lead
    Thy footsteps to a slope of green access
    Where, like an infant's smile, over the dead
A light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread;
    And gray walls moulder round, on which dull Time
    Feeds, like slow fire upon a hoary brand;
    And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime,
    Pavilioning the dust of him who planned
    This refuge for his memory, doth stand
    Like flame transformed to marble; and beneath,
    A field is spread, on which a newer band
    Have pitched in Heaven's smile their camp of death,
Welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath.
    Here pause: these graves are all too young as yet
    To have outgrown the sorrow which consigned
    Its charge to each; and if the seal is set,
    Here, on one fountain of a mourning mind,
    Break it not thou! too surely shalt thou find
    Thine own well full, if thou returnest home,
    Of tears and gall. From the world's bitter wind
    Seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb.
What Adonais is, why fear we to become?
    The One remains, the many change and pass;
    Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly;
    Life, like a dome of many-coloured glass,
    Stains the white radiance of Eternity,
    Until Death tramples it to fragments.—Die,
    If thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek!
    Follow where all is fled!—Rome's azure sky,
    Flowers, ruins, statues, music, words, are weak
The glory they transfuse with fitting truth to speak.
    Why linger, why turn back, why shrink, my Heart?
    Thy hopes are gone before: from all things here
    They have departed; thou shouldst now depart!
    A light is passed from the revolving year,
    And man, and woman; and what still is dear
    Attracts to crush, repels to make thee wither.
    The soft sky smiles,—the low wind whispers near:
    'Tis Adonais calls! oh, hasten thither,
No more let Life divide what Death can join together.
    That Light whose smile kindles the Universe,
    That Beauty in which all things work and move,
    That Benediction which the eclipsing Curse
    Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love
    Which through the web of being blindly wove
    By man and beast and earth and air and sea,
    Burns bright or dim, as each are mirrors of
    The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.
    The breath whose might I have invoked in song
    Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven,
    Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng
    Whose sails were never to the tempest given;
    The massy earth and spherèd skies are riven!
    I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;
    Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,
    The soul of Adonais, like a star,
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.



Hast thou not seen, officious with delight,
    Move through the illumined air about the flower
The Bee, that fears to drink its purple light,
    Lest danger lurk within that Rose's bower?
Hast thou not marked the moth's enamoured flight
    About the Taper's flame at evening hour,
Till kindle in that monumental fire
His sunflower wings their own funereal pyre?
My heart, its wishes trembling to unfold,
    Thus round the Rose and Taper hovering came,
And Passion's slave, Distrust, in ashes cold,
    Smothered awhile, but could not quench the flame,—
Till Love, that grows by disappointment bold,
    And Opportunity, had conquered Shame;
And like the Bee and Moth, in act to close,
I burned my wings, and settled on the Rose.



    How eloquent are eyes!
Not the rapt poet's frenzied lay
When the soul's wildest feelings stray
    Can speak so well as they.
    How eloquent are eyes!
Not music's most impassioned note
On which Love's warmest fervours float
    Like them bids rapture rise.
    Love, look thus again,—
That your look may light a waste of years,
Darting the beam that conquers cares
    Through the cold shower of tears.
    Love, look thus again![....]



I would not be a king—enough
    Of woe it is to love;
The path to power is steep and rough,
    And tempests reign above.
I would not climb the imperial throne;
'Tis built on ice which fortune's sun
    Thaws in the height of noon.
Then farewell, king, yet were I one,
    Care would not come so soon.
Would he and I were far away
Keeping flocks on Himalay!



By the mossy brink,
With me the Prince shall sit and think;
    Shall muse in visioned Regency,
Rapped in bright dreams of dawning Royalty.



Those whom nor power, nor lying faith, nor toil,
    Nor custom, queen of many slaves, makes blind,
Have ever grieved that man should be the spoil
    Of his own weakness, and with earnest mind
Fed hopes of its redemption; these recur
    Chastened by deathful victory now, and find
Foundations in this foulest age, and stir
Me whom they cheer to be their minister.
Dark is the realm of grief: but human things
Those may not know who cannot weep for them.[....]
[....] Once more descend
    The shadows of my soul upon mankind,
For to those hearts with which they never blend,
    Thoughts are but shadows which the flashing mind
From the swift clouds which track its flight of fire,
    Casts on the gloomy world it leaves behind.[....]



That time is dead for ever, child!
Drowned, frozen, dead for ever!
    We look on the past
    And stare aghast
At the spectres wailing, pale and ghast,
Of hopes which thou and I beguiled
    To death on life's dark river.
The stream we gazed on then rolled by;
Its waves are unreturning;
    But we yet stand
    In a lone land,
Like tombs to mark the memory
Of hopes and fears, which fade and flee
    In the light of life's dim morning.



For me, my friend, if not that tears did tremble
    In my faint eyes, and that my heart beat fast
With feelings which make rapture pain resemble,
    Yet, from thy voice that falsehood starts aghast,
        I thank thee—let the tyrant keep
        His chains and tears, yea, let him weep
        With rage to see thee freshly risen,
        Like strength from slumber, from the prison,
In which he vainly hoped the soul to bind
Which on the chains must prey that fetter humankind.



Hark! the owlet flaps her wing,
    In the pathless dell beneath,
Hark! night ravens loudly sing,
    Tidings of despair and death.—
Horror covers all the sky,
    Clouds of darkness blot the moon,
Prepare! for mortal thou must die,
    Prepare to yield thy soul up soon—
Fierce the tempest raves around,
    Fierce the volleyed lightnings fly,
Crashing thunder shakes the ground,
    Fire and tumult fill the sky.—
Hark! the tolling village bell,
    Tells the hour of midnight come,
Now can blast the powers of Hell,
    Fiend-like goblins now can roam—
See! his crest all stained with rain,
    A warrior hastening speeds his way,
He starts, looks round him, starts again,
    And sighs for the approach of day.
See! his frantic steed he reigns,
    See! he lifts his hands on high,
Implores a respite to his pains,
    From the powers of the sky.—
He seeks an Inn, for faint from toil,
    Fatigue had bent his lofty form,
To rest his wearied limbs awhile,
    Fatigued with wandering and the storm.
Slow the door is opened wide—
    With trackless tread a stranger came,
His form Majestic, slow his stride,
    He sate, nor spake,—nor told his name—
Terror blanched the warrior's cheek,
    Cold sweat from his forehead ran,
In vain his tongue essayed to speak,—
    At last the stranger thus began:
‘Mortal! thou that saw'st the sprite,
    Tell me what I wish to know,
Or come with me before 'tis light,
    Where cypress trees and mandrakes grow.
‘Fierce the avenging Demon's ire,
    Fiercer than the wintry blast,
Fiercer than the lightning's fire,
    When the hour of twilight's past’—
The warrior raised his sunken eye,
    It met the stranger's sullen scowl,
‘Mortal! Mortal! thou must die,’
    In burning letters chilled his soul.

    In burning letters chilled his soul.
Stranger! whoso'er you are,
    I feel impelled my tale to tell—
Horrors stranger shalt thou hear,
    Horrors drear as those of Hell.
O'er my Castle silence reigned,
    Late the night and drear the hour,
When on the terrace I observed,
    A fleeting shadowy mist to lower.—
Light the cloud as summer fog,
    Which transient shuns the morning beam;
Fleeting as the cloud on bog,
    That hangs or on the mountain stream.—
Horror seized my shuddering brain,
    Horror dimmed my starting eye,
In vain I tried to speak,—In vain
    My limbs essayed the spot to fly—
At last the thin and shadowy form,
    With noiseless, trackless footsteps came,—
Its light robe floated on the storm,
    Its head was bound with lambent flame.
In chilling voice drear as the breeze
    Which sweeps along th'autumnal ground,
Which wanders through the leafless trees,
    Or the mandrake's groan which floats around.
‘Thou art mine and I am thine,
    'Till the sinking of the world,
I am thine and thou art mine,
    'Till in ruin death is hurled—
‘Strong the power and dire the fate,
    Which drags me from the depths of Hell,
Breaks the tomb's eternal gate,
    Where fiendish shapes and dead men yell,
‘Haply I might ne'er have shrank
    From flames that rack the guilty dead,
Haply I might ne'er have sank
    On pleasure's flow'ry, thorny bed—
—‘But stay! no more I dare disclose,
    Of the tale I wish to tell,
On Earth relentless were my woes,
    But fiercer are my pangs in Hell—
‘Now I claim thee as my love,
    Lay aside all chilling fear,
My affection will I prove,
    Where sheeted ghosts and spectres are!
‘For thou art mine, and I am thine,
    'Till the dreaded judgement day,
I am thine, and thou art mine—
    Night is past—I must away.’
Still I gazed, and still the form
    Pressed upon my aching sight,
Still I braved the howling storm,
    When the ghost dissolved in night.—
Restless, sleepless fled the night,
    Sleepless as a sick man's bed,
When he sighs for morning light,
    When he turns his aching head,—
Slow and painful passed the day,
    Melancholy seized my brain,
Lingering fled the hours away,
    Lingering to a wretch in pain.—
At last came night, ah! horrid hour,
    Ah! chilling time that wakes the dead,
When demons ride the clouds that lower,
    —The phantom sat upon my bed.
In hollow voice, low as the sound
    Which in some charnel makes its moan,
What floats along the burying ground,
    The phantom claimed me as her own.
Her chilling finger on my head,
    With coldest touch congealed my soul—
Cold as the finger of the dead,
    Or damps which round a tombstone roll—
Months are passed in lingering round,
    Every night the spectre comes,
With thrilling step it shakes the ground,
    With thrilling step it round me roams—
Stranger! I have told to thee,
    All the tale I have to tell—
Stranger! canst thou tell to me,
    How to 'scape the powers of Hell?’—
Stranger! whoso'er you are,
    I feel impelled my tale to tell—

Warrior! I can ease thy woes,
    Wilt thou, wilt thou, come with me—
Warrior! I can all disclose,
    Follow, follow, follow me.
Yet the tempest's duskiest wing,
    Its mantle stretches o'er the sky,
Yet the midnight ravens sing,
    ‘Mortal! Mortal! thou must die.’

At last they saw a river clear,
    That crossed the heathy path they trod,
The Stranger's look was wild and drear,
    The firm Earth shook beneath his nod—
He raised a wand above his head,
    He traced a circle on the plain,
In a wild verse he called the dead,
    The dead with silent footsteps came.
A burning brilliance on his head,
    Flaming filled the stormy air,
In a wild verse he called the dead,
    The dead in motley crowd were there.—
‘Ghasta! Ghasta! come along,
    Bring thy fiendish crowd with thee,
Quickly raise th'avenging Song,
    Ghasta! Ghasta! come to me.’
Horrid shapes in mantles gray,
    Flit athwart the stormy night,
‘Ghasta! Ghasta! come away,
    Come away before 'tis light.’
See! the sheeted Ghost they bring,
    Yelling dreadful o'er the heath,
Hark! the deadly verse they sing,
    Tidings of despair and death!
The yelling Ghost before him stands,
    See! she rolls her eyes around,
Now she lifts her bony hands,
    Now her footsteps shake the ground.

Phantom of Theresa say,
    Why to earth again you came,
Quickly speak, I must away!
    Or you must bleach for aye in flame,—
Phantom of Theresa say,
    Why to earth again you came,
Quickly speak, I must away!
    Or you must bleach for aye in flame,—
Mighty one I know thee now,
    Mightiest power of the sky,
Know thee by thy flaming brow,
    Know thee by thy sparkling eye.
That fire is scorching! Oh! I came,
    From the caverned depth of Hell,
My fleeting false Rodolph to claim,
    Mighty one! I know thee well.—

Ghasta! seize yon wandering sprite,
    Drag her to the depth beneath,
Take her swift, before 'tis light,
    Take her to the cells of death!
Thou that heardst the trackless dead,
    In the mouldering tomb must lie,
Mortal! look upon my head,
    Mortal! Mortal! thou must die.

Of glowing flame a cross was there,
    Which threw a light around his form,
Whilst his lank and raven hair,
    Floated wild upon the storm.—
The warrior upwards turned his eyes,
    Gazed upon the cross of fire,
There sat horror and surprise,
    There sat God's eternal ire.—
A shivering through the Warrior flew,
    Colder than the nightly blast,
Colder than the evening dew,
    When the hour of twilight's past.—
Thunder shakes th'expansive sky,
    Shakes the bosom of the heath,
‘Mortal! Mortal! thou must die’—
    The warrior sank convulsed in death.

He wanders, like a day-appearing dream,
    Through the dim wildernesses of the mind;
Through desert woods and tracts, which seem
    Like ocean, homeless, boundless, unconfined.



How swiftly through Heaven's wide expanse
    Bright day's resplendent colours fade!
How sweetly does the moonbeam's glance
    With silver tint St. Irvyne's glade!
No cloud along the spangled air,
    Is borne upon the evening breeze;
How solemn is the scene! how fair
    The moonbeams rest upon the trees!
Yon dark gray turret glimmers white,
    Upon it sits the mournful owl;
Along the stillness of the night,
    Her melancholy shriekings roll.
But not alone on Irvyne's tower,
    The silver moonbeam pours her ray;
It gleams upon the ivied bower,
    It dances in the cascade's spray.
‘Ah! why do dark'ning shades conceal
    The hour, when man must cease to be?
Why may not human minds unveil
    The dim mists of futurity?
‘The keenness of the world hath torn
    The heart which opens to its blast;
Despised, neglected, and forlorn,
    Sinks the wretch in death at last.’



Summer was dead and Autumn was expiring,
    And infant Winter laughed upon the land
All cloudlessly and cold;—when I, desiring
    More in this world than any understand,
Wept o'er the beauty, which, like sea retiring,
    Had left the earth bare as the wave-worn sand
Of my lorn heart, and o'er the grass and flowers
Pale for the falsehood of the flattering Hours.
Summer was dead, but I yet lived to weep
    The instability of all but weeping;
And on the Earth lulled in her winter sleep
    I woke, and envied her as she was sleeping.
Too happy Earth! over thy face shall creep
    The wakening vernal airs, until thou, leaping
From unremembered dreams, shalt [....] see
No death divide thy immortality.
I loved—oh, no, I mean not one of ye,
    Or any earthly one, though ye are dear
As human heart to human heart may be;—
    I loved, I know not what—but this low sphere
And all that it contains, contains not thee,
    Thou, whom, seen nowhere, I feel everywhere.
From Heaven and Earth, and all that in them are,
Veiled art thou, like a [....] star.
By Heaven and Earth, from all whose shapes thou flowest,
    Neither to be contained, delayed, nor hidden;
Making divine the loftiest and the lowest,
    When for a moment thou art not forbidden
To live within the life which thou bestowest;
    And leaving noblest things vacant and chidden,
Cold as a corpse after the spirit's flight,
Blank as the sun after the birth of night.
In winds, and trees, and streams, and all things common,
    In music and the sweet unconscious tone
Of animals, and voices which are human,
    Meant to express some feelings of their own;
In the soft motions and rare smile of woman,
    In flowers and leaves, and in the grass fresh-shown,
Or dying in the autumn, I the most
Adore thee present or lament thee lost.
And thus I went lamenting, when I saw
    A plant upon the river's margin lie,
Like one who loved beyond his nature's law,
    And in despair had cast him down to die;
Its leaves, which had outlived the frost, the thaw
    Had blighted; like a heart which hatred's eye
Can blast not, but which pity kills; the dew
Lay on its spotted leaves like tears too true.
The Heavens had wept upon it, but the Earth
    Had crushed it on her unmaternal breast[....]
I bore it to my chamber, and I planted
    It in a vase full of the lightest mould;
The winter beams which out of Heaven slanted
    Fell through the window-panes, disrobed of cold,
Upon its leaves and flowers; the stars which panted
    In evening for the Day, whose car has rolled
Over the horizon's wave, with looks of light
Smiled on it from the threshold of the night.
The mitigated influences of air
    And light revived the plant, and from it grew
Strong leaves and tendrils, and its flowers fair,
    Full as a cup with the vine's burning dew,
O'erflowed with golden colours; an atmosphere
    Of vital warmth enfolded it anew,
And every impulse sent to every part
The unbeheld pulsations of its heart.
Well might the plant grow beautiful and strong,
    Even if the air and sun had smiled not on it;
For one wept o'er it all the winter long
    Tears pure as Heaven's rain, which fell upon it
Hour after hour; for sounds of softest song
    Mixed with the stringèd melodies that won it
To leave the gentle lips on which it slept,
Had loosed the heart of him who sat and wept.
Had loosed his heart, and shook the leaves and flowers
    On which he wept, the while the savage storm
Waked by the darkest of December's hours
    Was raving round the chamber hushed and warm;
The birds were shivering in their leafless bowers,
    The fish were frozen in the pools, the form
Of every summer plant was dead [....]
Whilst this [....][....]



Dearest, best and brightest,
    Come away,
To the woods and to the fields!
Dearer than this fairest day
Which, like thee to those in sorrow,
Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
To the rough Year just awake
In its cradle in the brake.
The eldest of the Hours of Spring,
Into the Winter wandering,
Looks upon the leafless wood,
And the banks all bare and rude;
Found, it seems, this halcyon Morn
In February's bosom born,
Bending from Heaven, in azure mirth,
Kissed the cold forehead of the Earth,
And smiled upon the silent sea,
And bade the frozen streams be free;
And waked to music all the fountains,
And breathed upon the rigid mountains,
And made the wintry world appear
Like one on whom thou smilest, Dear.
Radiant Sister of the Day,
Awake! arise! and come away!
To the wild woods and the plains,
To the pools where winter rains
Image all the roof of leaves,
Where the pine its garland weaves
Sapless, gray, and ivy dun
Round stems that never kiss the sun—
To the sandhills of the sea,
Where the earliest violets be.
Now the last day of many days,
All beautiful and bright as thou,
The loveliest and the last, is dead,
Rise, Memory, and write its praise!
And do thy wonted work and trace
The epitaph of glory fled;
For now the Earth has changed its face,
A frown is on the Heaven's brow.
We wandered to the Pine Forest
    That skirts the Ocean's foam,
The lightest wind was in its nest,
    The tempest in its home.
The whispering waves were half asleep,
    The clouds were gone to play,
And on the woods, and on the deep
    The smile of Heaven lay.
It seemed as if the day were one
    Sent from beyond the skies,
Which shed to earth above the sun
    A light of Paradise.
We paused amid the pines that stood,
    The giants of the waste,
Tortured by storms to shapes as rude
    With stems like serpents interlaced.
How calm it was—the silence there
    By such a chain was bound,
That even the busy woodpecker
    Made stiller by her sound
The inviolable quietness;
    The breath of peace we drew
With its soft motion made not less
    The calm that round us grew.
It seemed that from the remotest seat
    Of the white mountain's waste
To the bright flower beneath our feet,
    A magic circle traced;—
A spirit interfused around,
    A thinking, silent life;
To momentary peace it bound
    Our mortal nature's strife;—
And still, it seemed, the centre of
    The magic circle there,
Was one whose being filled with love
    The breathless atmosphere.
Were not the crocuses that grew
    Under that ilex-tree
As beautiful in scent and hue
    As ever fed the bee?
We stood beneath the pools that lie
    Under the forest bough,
And each seemed like a sky
    Gulfed in a world below;
A purple firmament of light
    Which in the dark earth lay,
More boundless than the depth of night,
    And clearer than the day—
In which the massy forests grew
    As in the upper air,
More perfect both in shape and hue
    Than any waving there.
Like one beloved the scene had lent
    To the dark water's breast
Its every leaf and lineament
    With that clear truth expressed;
There lay far glades and neighbouring lawn,
    And through the dark green crowd
The white sun twinkling like the dawn
    Under a speckled cloud.
Sweet views, which in our world above
    Can never well be seen,
Were imaged by the water's love
    Of that fair forest green.
And all was interfused beneath
    With an Elysian air,
An atmosphere without a breath,
    A silence sleeping there.
Until a wandering wind crept by,
    Like an unwelcome thought.
Which from my mind's too faithful eye
    Blots thy bright image out.
For thou art good and dear and kind,
    The forest ever green,
But less of peace in S's mind,
    Than calm in waters, seen.
We wandered to the Pine Forest
    That skirts the Ocean's foam,

    The tempest in its home.

Ariel to Miranda:—Take
This slave of music, for the sake
Of him, who is the slave of thee;
And teach it all the harmony
In which thou canst, and only thou,
Make the delighted spirit glow,
Till joy denies itself again
And, too intense, is turn'd to pain.
For by permission and command
Of thine own Prince Ferdinand,
Poor Ariel sends this silent token
Of more than ever can be spoken;
Your guardian spirit, Ariel, who
From life to life must still pursue
Your happiness, for thus alone
Can Ariel ever find his own.
From Prospero's enchanted cell,
As the mighty verses tell,
To the throne of Naples he
Lit you o'er the trackless sea,
Flitting on, your prow before,
Like a living meteor.
When you die, the silent Moon
In her interlunar swoon
Is not sadder in her cell
Than deserted Ariel:—
When you live again on earth,
Like an unseen Star of birth
Ariel guides you o'er the sea
Of life from your nativity:—
Many changes have been run
Since Ferdinand and you begun
Your course of love, and Ariel still
Has track'd your steps and served your will.
Now in humbler, happier lot,
This is all remember'd not;
And now, alas! the poor Sprite is
Imprison'd for some fault of his
In a body like a grave—
From you he only dares to crave,
For his service and his sorrow
A smile to day, a song to morrow.
The artist who this idol wrought
To echo all harmonious thought,
Fell'd a tree, while on the steep
The woods were in their winter sleep,
Rock'd in that repose divine
On the wind-swept Apennine;
And dreaming, some of Autumn past,
And some of Spring approaching fast,
And some of April buds and showers,
And some of songs in July bowers,
And all of love: And so this tree,—
Oh that such our death may be!—
Died in sleep, and felt no pain,
To live in happier form again:
From which, beneath heaven's fairest star,
The artist wrought this loved Guitar;
And taught it justly to reply
To all who question skilfully
In language gentle as thine own;
Whispering in enamour'd tone
Sweet oracles of woods and dells,
And summer winds in sylvan cells:
—For it had learnt all harmonies
Of the plains and of the skies,
Of the forests and the mountains,
And the many-voicéd fountains;
The clearest echoes of the hills,
The softest notes of falling rills,
The melodies of birds and bees,
The murmuring of summer seas,
And pattering rain, and breathing dew,
And airs of evening; and it knew
That seldom-heard mysterious sound
Which, driven on its diurnal round,
As it floats through boundless day,
Our world enkindles on its way:
—All this it knows, but will not tell
To those who cannot question well
The Spirit that inhabits it;
It talks according to the wit
Of its companions; and no more
Is heard than has been felt before
By those who tempt it to betray
These secrets of an elder day.
But, sweetly as its answers will
Flatter hands of perfect skill,
It keeps its highest holiest tone
For our beloved Friend alone.



I sing the glorious Power with azure eyes,
Athenian Pallas! tameless, chaste, and wise,
Tritogenia, town-preserving Maid,
Revered and mighty; from his awful head
Whom Jove brought forth, in warlike armour dressed,
Golden, all radiant! wonder strange possessed
The everlasting Gods that Shape to see,
Shaking a javelin keen, impetuously
Rush from the crest of Aegis-bearing Jove;
Fearfully Heaven was shaken, and did move
Beneath the might of the Cerulean-eyed;
Earth dreadfully resounded, far and wide;
And, lifted from its depths, the sea swelled high
In purple billows, the tide suddenly
Stood still, and great Hyperion's son long time
Checked his swift steeds, till, where she stood sublime,
Pallas from her immortal shoulders threw
The arms divine; wise Jove rejoiced to view.
Child of the Aegis-bearer, hail to thee,
Nor thine nor others' praise shall unremembered be.



Place, for the Marshal of the Masque!
What thinkest thou of this quaint masque which turns,
Like morning from the shadow of the night,
The night to day, and London to a place
Of peace and joy?
And Hell to Heaven.
Eight years are gone,
And they seem hours, since in this populous street
I trod on grass made green by summer's rain,
For the red plague kept state within that palace
Where now that vanity reigns. In nine years more
The roots will be refreshed with civil blood;
And thank the mercy of insulted Heaven
That sin and wrongs wound, as an orphan's cry,
The patience of the great Avenger's ear.
Yet, father, 'tis a happy sight to see,
Beautiful, innocent, and unforbidden
By God or man;—'tis like the bright procession
Of skiey visions in a solemn dream
From which men wake as from a Paradise,
And draw new strength to tread the thorns of life.
If God be good, wherefore should this be evil?
And if this be not evil, dost thou not draw
Unseasonable poison from the flowers
Which bloom so rarely in this barren world?
Oh, kill these bitter thoughts which make the present
Dark as the future!—[....]
When Avarice and Tyranny, vigilant Fear,
And open-eyed Conspiracy lie sleeping
As on Hell's threshold; and all gentle thoughts
Waken to worship Him who giveth joys
With His own gift.
How young art thou in this old age of time!
How green in this gray world? Canst thou discern
The signs of seasons, yet perceive no hint
Of change in that stage-scene in which thou art
Not a spectator but an actor? or
Art thou a puppet moved by [enginery]?
The day that dawns in fire will die in storms,
Even though the noon be calm. My travel's done,—
Before the whirlwind wakes I shall have found
My inn of lasting rest; but thou must still
Be journeying on in this inclement air.
Wrap thy old cloak about thy back;
Nor leave the broad and plain and beaten road,
Although no flowers smile on the trodden dust,
For the violet paths of pleasure. This Charles the First
Rose like the equinoctial sun, . . .
By vapours, through whose threatening ominous veil
Darting his altered influence he has gained
This height of noon—from which he must decline
Amid the darkness of conflicting storms,
To dank extinction and to latest night . . .
    There goes
The apostate Strafford; he whose titles
    whispered aphorisms
From Machiavel and Bacon: and, if Judas
Had been as brazen and as bold as he—
That
Is the Archbishop.
Rather say the Pope:
London will be soon his Rome: he walks
As if he trod upon the heads of men:
He looks elate, drunken with blood and gold;—
Beside him moves the Babylonian woman
Invisibly, and with her as with his shadow,
Mitred adulterer! he is joined in sin,
Which turns Heaven's milk of mercy to revenge.
Good Lord! rain it down upon him! [....]
Amid her ladies walks the papist queen,
As if her nice feet scorned our English earth.
The Canaanitish Jezebel! I would be
A dog if I might tear her with my teeth!
There's old Sir Henry Vane, the Earl of Pembroke,
Lord Essex, and Lord Keeper Coventry,
And others who make base their English breed
By vile participation of their honours
With papists, atheists, tyrants, and apostates.
When lawyers masque 'tis time for honest men
To strip the vizor from their purposes.
A seasonable time for masquers this!
When Englishmen and Protestants should sit
    [....] dust on their dishonoured heads,
To avert the wrath of Him whose scourge is felt
For the great sins which have drawn down from Heaven
    [....] and foreign overthrow.
The remnant of the martyred saints in Rochefort
Have been abandoned by their faithless allies
To that idolatrous and adulterous torturer
Lewis of France,—the Palatinate is lost—Enter Leighton (who has been branded in the face) and Bastwick.

Canst thou be—art thou—?
I was Leighton: what
I am thou seest. And yet turn thine eyes,
And with thy memory look on thy friend's mind,
Which is unchanged, and where is written deep
The sentence of my judge.
Are these the marks with which
Laud thinks to improve the image of his Maker
Stamped on the face of man? Curses upon him,
The impious tyrant!
It is said besides
That lewd and papist drunkards may profane
The Sabbath with their [....]
And has permitted that most heathenish custom
Of dancing round a pole dressed up with wreaths
On May-day.
A man who thus twice crucifies his God
May well [....] his brother.—In my mind, friend,
The root of all this ill is prelacy.
I would cut up the root.
And by what means?
Smiting each Bishop under the fifth rib.
You seem to know the vulnerable place
Of these same crocodiles.
I learnt it in
Egyptian bondage, sir. Your worm of Nile
Betrays not with its flattering tears like they;
For, when they cannot kill, they whine and weep.
Nor is it half so greedy of men's bodies
As they of soul and all; nor does it wallow
In slime as they in simony and lies
And close lusts of the flesh.
Give place, give place!
You torch-bearers, advance to the great gate,
And then attend the Marshal of the Masque
Into the Royal presence.
What thinkest thou
Of this quaint show of ours, my agèd friend?
Even now we see the redness of the torches
Inflame the night to the eastward, and the clarions
[Gasp?] to us on the wind's wave. It comes!
And their sounds, floating hither round the pageant,
Rouse up the astonished air.
I will not think but that our country's wounds
May yet be healed. The king is just and gracious,
Though wicked counsels now pervert his will:
These once cast off—
As adders cast their skins
And keep their venom, so kings often change;
Councils and counsellors hang on one another,
Hiding the loathsome
Like the base patchwork of a leper's rags.
Oh, still those dissonant thoughts!—List how the music
Grows on the enchanted air! And see, the torches
Restlessly flashing, and the crowd divided
Like waves before an admiral's prow!
Give place
To the Marshal of the Masque!
Room for the King!
How glorious! See those thronging chariots
Rolling, like painted clouds before the wind,
Behind their solemn steeds: how some are shaped
Like curved sea-shells dyed by the azure depths
Of Indian seas; some like the new-born moon;
And some like cars in which the Romans climbed
(Canopied by Victory's eagle-wings outspread)
The Capitolian—See how gloriously
The mettled horses in the torchlight stir
Their gallant riders, while they check their pride,
Like shapes of some diviner element
Than English air, and beings nobler than
The envious and admiring multitude.
Ay, there they are—
Nobles, and sons of nobles, patentees,
Monopolists, and stewards of this poor farm,
On whose lean sheep sit the prophetic crows,
Here is the pomp that strips the houseless orphan,
Here is the pride that breaks the desolate heart.
These are the lilies glorious as Solomon,
Who toil not, neither do they spin,—unless
It be the webs they catch poor rogues withal.
Here is the surfeit which to them who earn
The niggard wages of the earth, scarce leaves
The tithe that will support them till they crawl
Back to her cold hard bosom. Here is health
Followed by grim disease, glory by shame,
Waste by lame famine, wealth by squalid want,
And England's sin by England's punishment.
And, as the effect pursues the cause foregone,
Lo, giving substance to my words, behold
At once the sign and the thing signified—
A troop of cripples, beggars, and lean outcasts,
Horsed upon stumbling jades, carted with dung,
Dragged for a day from cellars and low cabins
And rotten hiding-holes, to point the moral
Of this presentment, and bring up the rear
Of painted pomp with misery!
'Tis but
The anti-masque, and serves as discords do
In sweetest music. Who would love May flowers
If they succeeded not to Winter's flaw;
Or day unchanged by night; or joy itself
Without the touch of sorrow?
I and thou—
Place, give place!
Thanks, gentlemen. I heartily accept
This token of your service: your gay masque
Was performed gallantly. And it shows well
When subjects twine such flowers of [observance?]
With the sharp thorns that deck the English crown.
A gentle heart enjoys what it confers,
Even as it suffers that which it inflicts,
Though Justice guides the stroke.
Accept my hearty thanks.
And gentlemen,
Call your poor Queen your debtor. Your quaint pageant
Rose on me like the figures of past years,
Treading their still path back to infancy,
More beautiful and mild as they draw nearer
The quiet cradle. I could have almost wept
To think I was in Paris, where these shows
Are well devised—such as I was ere yet
My young heart shared a portion of the burthen,
The careful weight, of this great monarchy.
There, gentlemen, between the sovereign's pleasure
And that which it regards, no clamour lifts
Its proud interposition.
In Paris ribald censurers dare not move
Their poisonous tongues against these sinless sports;
And his smile
Warms those who bask in it, as ours would do
If . . . Take my heart's thanks: add them, gentlemen,
To those good words which, were he King of France,
My royal lord would turn to golden deeds.
Madam, the love of Englishmen can make
The lightest favour of their lawful king
Outweigh a despot's.—We humbly take our leaves,
Enriched by smiles which France can never buy.
My Lord Archbishop,
Mark you what spirit sits in St. John's eyes?
Methinks it is too saucy for this presence.
A rod in pickle for the Fool's back!
These stiff Scots
His Grace of Canterbury must take order
To force under the Church's yoke.—You, Wentworth,
Shall be myself in Ireland, and shall add
Your wisdom, gentleness, and energy,
To what in me were wanting.—My Lord Weston,
Look that those merchants draw not without loss
Their bullion from the Tower; and, on the payment
Of shipmoney, take fullest compensation
For violation of our royal forests,
Whose limits, from neglect, have been o'ergrown
With cottages and cornfields. The uttermost
Farthing exact from those who claim exemption
From knighthood: that which once was a reward
Shall thus be made a punishment, that subjects
May know how majesty can wear at will
The rugged mood.—My Lord of Coventry,
Lay my command upon the Courts below
That bail be not accepted for the prisoners
Under the warrant of the Star Chamber.
The people shall not find the stubbornness
Of Parliament a cheap or easy method
Of dealing with their rightful sovereign:
And doubt not this, my Lord of Coventry,
We will find time and place for fit rebuke.—
My Lord of Canterbury.
The fool is here.
I crave permission of your Majesty
To order that this insolent fellow be
Chastised: he mocks the sacred character,
Scoffs at the state, and—
What, my Archy?
He mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,
Yet with a quaint and graceful licence—Prithee
For this once do not as Prynne would, were he
Primate of England. With your Grace's leave,
He lives in his own world; and, like a parrot
Hung in his gilded prison from the window
Of a queen's bower over the public way,
Blasphemes with a bird's mind:—his words, like arrows
Which know no aim beyond the archer's wit,
Strike sometimes what eludes philosophy.—

(To Archy.) Go, sirrah, and repent of your offence
Ten minutes in the rain; be it your penance
To bring news how the world goes there.
Poor Archy!
He weaves about himself a world of mirth
Out of the wreck of ours.
What, my Archy?
He mocks and mimics all he sees and hears,
Yet with a quaint and graceful licence—Prithee
For this once do not as Prynne would, were he
Primate of England. With your Grace's leave,
He lives in his own world; and, like a parrot
Hung in his gilded prison from the window
Of a queen's bower over the public way,
Blasphemes with a bird's mind:—his words, like arrows
Which know no aim beyond the archer's wit,
Strike sometimes what eludes philosophy.—

(To Archy.) Go, sirrah, and repent of your offence
Ten minutes in the rain; be it your penance
To bring news how the world goes there.
Poor Archy!
He weaves about himself a world of mirth
Out of the wreck of ours.
I take with patience, as my Master did,
All scoffs permitted from above.
My lord,
Pray overlook these papers. Archy's words
Had wings, but these have talons.
And the lion
That wears them must be tamed. My dearest lord,
I see the new-born courage in your eye
Armed to strike dead the Spirit of the Time,
Which spurs to rage the many-headed beast.
Do thou persist: for, faint but in resolve,
And it were better thou hadst still remained
The slave of thine own slaves, who tear like curs
The fugitive, and flee from the pursuer;
And Opportunity, that empty wolf,
Flies at his throat who falls. Subdue thy actions
Even to the disposition of thy purpose,
And be that tempered as the Ebro's steel;
And banish weak-eyed Mercy to the weak,
Whence she will greet thee with a gift of peace,
And not betray thee with a traitor's kiss,
As when she keeps the company of rebels,
Who think that she is Fear. This do, lest we
Should fall as from a glorious pinnacle
In a bright dream, and wake as from a dream
Out of our worshipped state.
Belovèd friend,
God is my witness that this weight of power,
Which He sets me my earthly task to wield.
Under His law, is my delight and pride
Only because thou lovest that and me.
For a king bears the office of a God
To all the under world; and to his God
Alone he must deliver up his trust,
Unshorn of its permitted attributes.
[It seems] now as the baser elements
Had mutinied against the golden sun
That kindles them to harmony and quells
Their self-destroying rapine. The wild million
Strike at the eye that guides them; like as humours
Of the distempered body that conspire
Against the spirit of life throned in the heart,—
And thus become the prey of one another,
And last of death—
That which would be ambition in a subject
Is duty in a sovereign; for on him,
As on a keystone, hangs the arch of life,
Whose safety is its strength. Degree and form,
And all that makes the age of reasoning man
More memorable than a beast's, depend on this—
That Right should fence itself inviolably
With Power; in which respect the state of England
From usurpation by the insolent commons
Cries for reform.
Get treason, and spare treasure. Fee with coin
The loudest murmurers; feed with jealousies
Opposing factions,—be thyself of none;
And borrow gold of many, for those who lend
Will serve thee till thou payest them; and thus
Keep the fierce spirit of the hour at bay,
Till time, and its coming generations
Of nights and days unborn, bring some one chance,[....]
Or war or pestilence or Nature's self,—
By some distemperature or terrible sign,
Be as an arbiter betwixt themselves.
[....] Nor let your Majesty
Doubt here the peril of the unseen event.
How did your brother Kings, coheritors
In your high interest in the subject earth,
Rise past such troubles to that height of power
Where now they sit, and awfully serene
Smile on the trembling world? Such popular storms
Philip the Second of Spain, this Lewis of France,
And late the German head of many bodies,
And every petty lord of Italy,
Quelled or by arts or arms. Is England poorer
Or feebler? or art thou who wield'st her power
Tamer than they? or shall this island be—
[Girdled] by its inviolable waters—
To the world present and the world to come
Sole pattern of extinguished monarchy?
Not if thou dost as I would have thee do.
Your words shall be my deeds:
You speak the image of my thought. My friend
(If Kings can have a friend, I call thee so),
Beyond the large commission which [belongs]
Under the great seal of the realm, take this:
And, for some obvious reasons, let there be
No seal on it, except my kingly word
And honour as I am a gentleman.
Be—as thou art within my heart and mind—
Another self, here and in Ireland:
Do what thou judgest well, take amplest licence,
And stick not even at questionable means.
Hear me, Wentworth. My word is as a wall
Between thee and this world thine enemy—
That hates thee, for thou lovest me.
I own
No friend but thee, no enemies but thine:
Thy lightest thought is my eternal law.
How weak, how short, is life to pay—
Peace, peace.
Thou ow'st me nothing yet.

(To Laud.) My lord, what say
Those papers?
Peace, peace.
Thou ow'st me nothing yet.

(To Laud.) My lord, what say
Those papers?
Your Majesty has ever interposed,
In lenity towards your native soil,
Between the heavy vengeance of the Church
And Scotland. Mark the consequence of warming
This brood of northern vipers in your bosom.
The rabble, instructed no doubt
By Loudon, Lindsay, Hume, and false Argyll
(For the waves never menace heaven until
Scourged by the wind's invisible tyranny),
Have in the very temple of the Lord
Done outrage to His chosen ministers.
They scorn the liturgy of the Holy Church,
Refuse to obey her canons, and deny
The apostolic power with which the Spirit
Has filled its elect vessels, even from him
Who held the keys with power to loose and bind,
To him who now pleads in this royal presence.—
Let ample powers and new instructions be
Sent to the High Commissioners in Scotland.
To death, imprisonment, and confiscation,
Add torture, add the ruin of the kindred
Of the offender, add the brand of infamy,
Add mutilation: and if this suffice not,
Unleash the sword and fire, that in their thirst
They may lick up that scum of schismatics.
I laugh at those weak rebels who, desiring
What we possess, still prate of Christian peace,
As if those dreadful arbitrating messengers
Which play the part of God 'twixt right and wrong,
Should be let loose against the innocent sleep
Of templed cities and the smiling fields,
For some poor argument of policy
Which touches our own profit or our pride
(Where it indeed were Christian charity
To turn the cheek even to the smiter's hand):
And, when our great Redeemer, when our God,
When He who gave, accepted, and retained
Himself in propitiation of our sins,
Is scorned in His immediate ministry,
With hazard of the inestimable loss
Of all the truth and discipline which is
Salvation to the extremest generation
Of men innumerable, they talk of peace!
Such peace as Canaan found, let Scotland now:
For, by that Christ who came to bring a sword,
Not peace, upon the earth, and gave command
To His disciples at the Passover
That each should sell his robe and buy a sword,—
Once strip that minister of naked wrath,
And it shall never sleep in peace again
Till Scotland bend or break.
My Lord Archbishop,
Do what thou wilt and what thou canst in this.
Thy earthly even as thy heavenly King
Gives thee large power in his unquiet realm.
But we want money, and my mind misgives me
That for so great an enterprise, as yet,
We are unfurnished.
Yet it may not long
Rest on our wills.
The expenses
Of gathering shipmoney, and of distraining
For every petty rate (for we encounter
A desperate opposition inch by inch
In every warehouse and on every farm),
Have swallowed up the gross sum of the imposts;
So that, though felt as a most grievous scourge
Upon the land, they stand us in small stead
As touches the receipt.
'Tis a conclusion
Most arithmetical: and thence you infer
Perhaps the assembling of a parliament.
Now, if a man should call his dearest enemies
To sit in licensed judgement on his life,
His Majesty might wisely take that course.[Aside to Cottington.

It is enough to expect from these lean imposts
That they perform the office of a scourge,
Without more profit. (Aloud.) Fines and confiscations,
And a forced loan from the refractory city,
Will fill our coffers: and the golden love
Of loyal gentlemen and noble friends
For the worshipped father of our common country,
With contributions from the catholics,
Will make Rebellion pale in our excess.
Be these the expedients until time and wisdom
Shall frame a settled state of government.
And weak expedients they! Have we not drained
All, till the [....] which seemed
A mine exhaustless?
And the love which is,
If loyal hearts could turn their blood to gold.
Both now grow barren: and I speak it not
As loving parliaments, which, as they have been
In the right hand of bold bad mighty kings
The scourges of the bleeding Church, I hate.
Methinks they scarcely can deserve our fear.
Oh! my dear liege, take back the wealth thou gavest:
With that, take all I held, but as in trust
For thee, of mine inheritance: leave me but
This unprovided body for thy service,
And a mind dedicated to no care
Except thy safety:—but assemble not
A parliament. Hundreds will bring, like me,
Their fortunes, as they would their blood, before—
No! thou who judgest them art but one. Alas!
We should be too much out of love with Heaven,
Did this vile world show many such as thee,
Thou perfect, just, and honourable man!
Never shall it be said that Charles of England
Stripped those he loved for fear of those he scorns;
Nor will he so much misbecome his throne
As to impoverish those who most adorn
And best defend it. That you urge, dear Strafford,
Inclines me rather—
To a parliament?
Is this thy firmness? and thou wilt preside
Over a knot of [....] censurers,
To the unswearing of thy best resolves,
And choose the worst, when the worst comes too soon?
Plight not the worst before the worst must come.
Oh, wilt thou smile whilst our ribald foes,
Dressed in their own usurped authority,
Sharpen their tongues on Henrietta's fame?
It is enough! Thou lovest me no more!
Oh, Henrietta!
Money we have none:
And all the expedients of my Lord of Strafford
Will scarcely meet the arrears.
Without delay
An army must be sent into the north;
Followed by a Commission of the Church,
With amplest power to quench in fire and blood,
And tears and terror, and the pity of hell,
The intenser wrath of Heresy. God will give
Victory; and victory over Scotland give
The lion England tamed into our hands.
That will lend power, and power bring gold.
Meanwhile
We must begin first where your Grace leaves off.
Gold must give power, or—
I am not averse
From the assembling of a parliament.
Strong actions and smooth words might teach them soon
The lesson to obey. And are they not
A bubble fashioned by the monarch's mouth,
The birth of one light breath? If they serve no purpose,
A word dissolves them.
The engine of parliaments
Might be deferred until I can bring over
The Irish regiments: they will serve to assure
The issue of the war against the Scots.
And, this game won—which if lost, all is lost—
Gather these chosen leaders of the rebels,
And call them, if you will, a parliament.
Oh, be our feet still tardy to shed blood,
Guilty though it may be! I would still spare
The stubborn country of my birth, and ward
From countenances which I loved in youth
The wrathful Church's lacerating hand.

(To Laud.) Have you o'erlooked the other articles?
Hazlerig, Hampden, Pym, young Harry Vane,
Cromwell, and other rebels of less note,
Intend to sail with the next favouring wind
For the Plantations.
Where they think to found
A commonwealth like Gonzalo's in the play,
Gynaecocoenic and pantisocratic.
What's that, sirrah?
New devil's politics.
Hell is the pattern of all commonwealths:
Lucifer was the first republican.
Will you hear Merlin's prophecy, how three [posts?]
‘In one brainless skull, when the whitethorn is full,
Shall sail round the world, and come back again:
Shall sail round the world in a brainless skull,
And come back again when the moon is at full:’—
When, in spite of the Church,
They will hear homilies of whatever length
Or form they please.
So please your Majesty to sign this order
For their detention.
Is the rain over, sirrah?
When it rains
And the sun shines, 'twill rain again to-morrow:
And therefore never smile till you've done crying.
‘A rainbow in the morning
Is the shepherd's warning;’
Enough, enough! Go desire Lady Jane
She place my lute, together with the music
Mari received last week from Italy,
In my boudoir, and—
I'll go in.
My beloved lord,
Have you not noted that the Fool of late
Has lost his careless mirth, and that his words
Sound like the echoes of our saddest fears?
What can it mean? I should be loth to think
Some factious slave had tutored him.
Oh, no!
He is but Occasion's pupil. Partly 'tis
That our minds piece the vacant intervals
Of his wild words with their own fashioning,—
As in the imagery of summer clouds,
Or coals of the winter fire, idlers find
The perfect shadows of their teeming thoughts:
And partly, that the terrors of the time
Are sown by wandering Rumour in all spirits;
And in the lightest and the least, may best
Be seen the current of the coming wind.
Your brain is overwrought with these deep thoughts.
Come, I will sing to you; let us go try
These airs from Italy; and, as we pass
The gallery, we'll decide where that Correggio
Shall hang—the Virgin Mother
With her child, born the King of heaven and earth,
Whose reign is men's salvation. And you shall see
A cradled miniature of yourself asleep,
Stamped on the heart by never-erring love;
Liker than any Vandyke ever made,
A pattern to the unborn age of thee,
Over whose sweet beauty I have wept for joy
A thousand times, and now should weep for sorrow,
Did I not think that after we were dead
Our fortunes would spring high in him, and that
The cares we waste upon our heavy crown
Would make it light and glorious as a wreath
Of Heaven's beams for his dear innocent brow.
Dear Henrietta!
Bring forth the prisoner Bastwick: let the clerk
Recite his sentence.
‘That he pay five thousand
Pounds to the king, lose both his ears, be branded
With red-hot iron on the cheek and forehead,
And be imprisoned within Lancaster Castle
During the pleasure of the Court.’
Prisoner,
If you have aught to say wherefore this sentence
Should not be put into effect, now speak.
If you have aught to plead in mitigation,
Speak.
Thus, my lords. If, like the prelates, I
Were an invader of the royal power,
A public scorner of the word of God,
Profane, idolatrous, popish, superstitious,
Impious in heart and in tyrannic act,
Void of wit, honesty, and temperance;
If Satan were my lord, as theirs,—our God
Pattern of all I should avoid to do;
Were I an enemy of my God and King
And of good men, as ye are;—I should merit
Your fearful state and gilt prosperity,
Which, when ye wake from the last sleep, shall turn
To cowls and robes of everlasting fire.
But, as I am, I bid ye grudge me not
The only earthly favour ye can yield,
Or I think worth acceptance at your hands,—
Scorn, mutilation, and imprisonment.
[....] even as my Master did,
Until Heaven's kingdom shall descend on earth,
Or earth be like a shadow in the light
Of Heaven absorbed—some few tumultuous years
Will pass, and leave no wreck of what opposes
His will whose will is power.
Officer, take the prisoner from the bar,
And be his tongue slit for his insolence.
While this hand holds a pen—
Be his hands—
Stop!
Forbear, my lord! The tongue, which now can speak
No terror, would interpret, being dumb,
Heaven's thunder to our harm; [....]
And hands, which now write only their own shame,
With bleeding stumps might sign our blood away.
Much more such ‘mercy’ among men would be,
Did all the ministers of Heaven's revenge
Flinch thus from earthly retribution. I
Could suffer what I would inflict.
Bring up
The Lord Bishop of Lincoln.—

(To Strafford.) Know you not
That, in distraining for ten thousand pounds
Upon his books and furniture at Lincoln,
Were found these scandalous and seditious letters
Sent from one Osbaldistone, who is fled?
I speak it not as touching this poor person;
But of the office which should make it holy,
Were it as vile as it was ever spotless.
Mark too, my lord, that this expression strikes
His Majesty, if I misinterpret not.

'Twere politic and just that Williams taste
The bitter fruit of his connection with
The schismatics. But you, my Lord Archbishop,
Who owed your first promotion to his favour,
Who grew beneath his smile—
Would therefore beg
The office of his judge from this High Court,—
That it shall seem, even as it is, that I,
In my assumption of this sacred robe,
Have put aside all worldly preference,
All sense of all distinction of all persons,
All thoughts but of the service of the Church.—
Bishop of Lincoln!
Peace, proud hierarch!
I know my sentence, and I own it just.
Thou wilt repay me less than I deserve,
In stretching to the utmost[....]
England, farewell! thou, who hast been my cradle,
Shalt never be my dungeon or my grave!
I held what I inherited in thee
As pawn for that inheritance of freedom
Which thou hast sold for thy despoiler's smile:
How can I call thee England, or my country?—
Does the wind hold?
The vanes sit steady
Upon the Abbey towers. The silver lightnings
Of the evening star, spite of the city's smoke,
Tell that the north wind reigns in the upper air.
Mark too that flock of fleecy-wingèd clouds
Sailing athwart St. Margaret's.
Hail, fleet herald
Of tempest! that rude pilot who shall guide
Hearts free as his, to realms as pure as thee,
Beyond the shot of tyranny,
Beyond the webs of that swoln spider [....]
Beyond the curses, calumnies, and [lies?]
Of atheist priests! [....] And thou
Fair star, whose beam lies on the wide Atlantic,
Athwart its zones of tempest and of calm,
Bright as the path to a belovèd home,
Oh, light us to the isles of the evening land!
Like floating Edens cradled in the glimmer
Of sunset, through the distant mist of years
Touched by departing hope, they gleam! lone regions,
Where Power's poor dupes and victims yet have never
Propitiated the savage fear of kings
With purest blood of noblest hearts; whose dew
Is yet unstained with tears of those who wake
To weep each day the wrongs on which it dawns;
Whose sacred silent air owns yet no echo
Of formal blasphemies; nor impious rites
Wrest man's free worship, from the God who loves,
To the poor worm who envies us His love!
Receive, thou young [....] of Paradise,
These exiles from the old and sinful world![....]
This glorious clime, this firmament, whose lights
Dart mitigated influence through their veil
Of pale blue atmosphere; whose tears keep green
The pavement of this moist all-feeding earth;
This vaporous horizon, whose dim round
Is bastioned by the circumfluous sea,
Repelling invasion from the sacred towers,
Presses upon me like a dungeon's grate,
A low dark roof, a damp and narrow wall.
The boundless universe
Becomes a cell too narrow for the soul
That owns no master; while the loathliest ward
Of this wide prison, England, is a nest
Of cradling peace built on the mountain tops,—
To which the eagle spirits of the free,
Which range through heaven and earth, and scorn the storm
Of time, and gaze upon the light of truth,
Return to brood on thoughts that cannot die
And cannot be repelled.
Like eaglets floating in the heaven of time,
They soar above their quarry, and shall stoop
Through palaces and temples thunderproof.
‘A widow bird sate mourning
Upon a wintry bough.’
Heigho! the lark and the owl!
    One flies the morning, and one lulls the night:—
Only the nightingale, poor fond soul,
    Sings like the fool through darkness and light.
‘A widow bird sate mourning for her love
    Upon a wintry bough;
The frozen wind crept on above,
    The freezing stream below.
‘There was no leaf upon the forest bare,
    No flower upon the ground,
And little motion in the air
    Except the mill-wheel's sound.’

I am drunk with the honey wine
Of the moon-unfolded eglantine,
Which fairies catch in hyacinth bowls.
The bats, the dormice, and the moles
Sleep in the walls or under the sward
Of the desolate castle yard;
And when 'tis spilt on the summer earth
    Or its fumes arise among the dew,
Their jocund dreams are full of mirth,
    They gibber their joy in sleep; for few
    Of the fairies bear those bowls so new!



Best and brightest, come away,—
Fairer far than this fair Day,
Which, like thee, to those in sorrow
Comes to bid a sweet good-morrow
To the rough year just awake
In its cradle on the brake.
The brightest hour of unborn Spring
Through the winter wandering,
Found, it seems, the halcyon morn
To hoar February born;
Bending from heaven, in azure mirth,
It kiss'd the forehead of the earth,
And smiled upon the silent sea,
And bade the frozen streams be free,
And waked to music all their fountains,
And breathed upon the frozen mountains,
And like a prophetess of May
Strew'd flowers upon the barren way,
Making the wintry world appear
Like one on whom thou smilest, dear.
Away, away, from men and towns,
To the wild wood and the downs—
To the silent wilderness
Where the soul need not repress
Its music, lest it should not find
An echo in another's mind,
While the touch of Nature's art
Harmonizes heart to heart.
Radiant Sister of the Day
Awake! arise! and come away!
To the wild woods and the plains,
To the pools where winter rains
Image all their roof of leaves,
Where the pine its garland weaves
Of sapless green, and ivy dun,
Round stems that never kiss the sun;
Where the lawns and pastures be
And the sandhills of the sea;
Where the melting hoar-frost wets
The daisy-star that never sets,
And wind-flowers and violets
Which yet join not scent to hue
Crown the pale year weak and new;
When the night is left behind
In the deep east, dim and blind,
And the blue noon is over us,
And the multitudinous
Billows murmur at our feet,
Where the earth and ocean meet,
And all things seem only one
In the universal Sun.



When a lover clasps his fairest,
Then be our dread sport the rarest.
Their caresses were like the chaff
In the tempest, and be our laugh
His despair—her epitaph!
When a mother clasps her child,
Watch till dusty Death has piled
His cold ashes on the clay;
She has loved it many a day—
She remains,—it fades away.



Wake the serpent not—lest he
Should not know the way to go,—
Let him crawl which yet lies sleeping
Through the deep grass of the meadow!
Not a bee shall hear him creeping,
Not a may-fly shall awaken
From its cradling blue-bell shaken,
Not the starlight as he's sliding
Through the grass with silent gliding.



How sweet it is to sit and read the tales
    Of mighty poets and to hear the while
Sweet music, which when the attention fails
    Fills the dim pause—



And where is truth? On tombs? for such to thee
Has been my heart—and thy dead memory
Has lain from childhood, many a changeful year,
Unchangingly preserved and buried there.



Month after month the gathered rains descend
Drenching yon secret Aethiopian dells,
And from the desert's ice-girt pinnacles
Where Frost and Heat in strange embraces blend
On Atlas, fields of moist snow half depend.
Girt there with blasts and meteors Tempest dwells
By Nile's aëreal urn, with rapid spells
Urging those waters to their mighty end.
O'er Egypt's land of Memory floods are level
And they are thine, O Nile—and well thou knowest
That soul-sustaining airs and blasts of evil
And fruits and poisons spring where'er thou flowest.
Beware, O Man—for knowledge must to thee,
Like the great flood to Egypt, ever be.



‘Sleep, sleep on! forget thy pain;
    My hand is on thy brow,
My spirit on thy brain;
My pity on thy heart, poor friend;
    And from my fingers flow
The powers of life, and like a sign,
    Seal thee from thine hour of woe;
And brood on thee, but may not blend
        With thine.
‘Sleep, sleep on! I love thee not;
    But when I think that he
Who made and makes my lot
As full of flowers as thine of weeds,
    Might have been lost like thee;
And that a hand which was not mine
    Might then have charmed his agony
As I another's—my heart bleeds
        For thine.
‘Sleep, sleep, and with the slumber of
    The dead and the unborn
Forget thy life and love;
Forget that thou must wake forever;
    Forget the world's dull scorn;
Forget lost health, and the divine
    Feelings which died in youth's brief morn;
And forget me, for I can never
        Be thine.
‘Like a cloud big with a May shower,
    My soul weeps healing rain
On thee, thou withered flower!
It breathes mute music on thy sleep;
    Its odour calms thy brain!
Its light within thy gloomy breast
    Spreads like a second youth again.
By mine thy being is to its deep
        Possessed.
‘The spell is done. How feel you now?’
    ‘Better—Quite well,’ replied
    The sleeper.—‘What would do
You good when suffering and awake?
    What cure your head and side?—’
‘What would cure, that would kill me, Jane:
    And as I must on earth abide
Awhile, yet tempt me not to break
        My chain.’



From the forests and highlands
        We come, we come;
From the river-girt islands,
        Where loud waves are dumb
            Listening to my sweet pipings.
The wind in the reeds and the rushes,
    The bees on the bells of thyme,
The birds on the myrtle bushes,
    The cicale above in the lime,
And the lizards below in the grass,
Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was,
            Listening to my sweet pipings.
Liquid Peneus was flowing,
        And all dark Tempe lay
In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing
        The light of the dying day,
            Speeded by my sweet pipings.
The Sileni, and Sylvans, and Fauns,
    And the Nymphs of the woods and the waves,
To the edge of the moist river-lawns,
    And the brink of the dewy caves,
And all that did then attend and follow,
Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo,
            With envy of my sweet pipings.
I sang of the dancing stars,
        I sang of the daedal Earth,
And of Heaven—and the giant wars,
        And Love, and Death, and Birth,—
            And then I changed my pipings,—
Singing how down the vale of Maenalus
    I pursued a maiden and clasped a reed.
Gods and men, we are all deluded thus!
    It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed:
All wept, as I think both ye now would,
If envy or age had not frozen your blood,
            At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.



To thirst and find no fill—to wail and wander
With short unsteady steps—to pause and ponder—
To feel the blood run through the veins and tingle
Where busy thought and blind sensation mingle;
To nurse the image of unfelt caresses
Till dim imagination just possesses
The half-created shadow, then all the night
Sick [....]



The golden gates of Sleep unbar
    Where Strength and Beauty, met together,
Kindle their image like a star
    In a sea of glassy weather!
Night, with all thy stars look down,—
    Darkness, weep thy holiest dew,—
Never smiled the inconstant moon
        On a pair so true.
Let eyes not see their own delight;—
Haste, swift Hour, and thy flight
            Oft renew.
Fairies, sprites, and angels, keep her!
    Holy stars, permit no wrong!
And return to wake the sleeper,
        Dawn,—ere it be long!
O joy! O fear! what will be done
In the absence of the sun!
            Come along!



Night, with all thine eyes look down!
    Darkness shed its holiest dew!
When ever smiled the inconstant moon
    On a pair so true?
Hence, coy hour! and quench thy light,
Lest eyes see their own delight!

        Oft renew.
O joy! O fear! what may be done
In the absence of the sun?
Come along!
The golden gates of sleep unbar!
    When strength and beauty meet together,
Kindles their image like a star
    In a sea of glassy weather.
Hence, coy hour! and quench thy light,
Lest eyes see their own delight!
Hence, swift hour! and thy loved flight

The world is now our dwelling-place;
Where'er the earth one fading trace
    Of what was great and free does keep,
That is our home! [....]
Mild thoughts of man's ungentle race
    Shall our contented exile reap;
For who that in some happy place
His own free thoughts can freely chase
By woods and waves can clothe his face
    In cynic smiles? Child! we shall weep.
[....] This lament,
    The memory of thy grievous wrong
Will fade [....]
But genius is omnipotent
To hallow [....]



What was the shriek that struck Fancy's ear
As it sate on the ruins of time that is past?
Hark! it floats on the fitful blast of the wind,
And breathes to the pale moon a funeral sigh.
It is the Benshie's moan on the storm,
Or a shivering fiend that thirsting for sin,
Seeks murder and guilt when virtue sleeps,
Winged with the power of some ruthless king,
And sweeps o'er the breast of the prostrate plain.
It was not a fiend from the regions of Hell
That poured its low moan on the stillness of night:
It was not a ghost of the guilty dead,
Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore;
But aye at the close of seven years' end,
That voice is mixed with the swell of the storm,
And aye at the close of seven years' end,
A shapeless shadow that sleeps on the hill
Awakens and floats on the mist of the heath.
It is not the shade of a murdered man,
Who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his God,
And howls in the pause of the eddying storm.
This voice is low, cold, hollow, and chill,
'Tis not heard by the ear, but is felt in the soul.
'Tis more frightful far than the death daemon's scream,
Or the laughter of fiends when they howl o'er the corpse
Of a man who has sold his soul to Hell.
It tells the approach of a mystic form,
A white courser bears the shadowy sprite;
More thin they are than the mists of the mountain,
When the clear moonlight sleeps on the waveless lake.
More pale his cheek than the snows of Nithona,
When winter rides on the northern blast,
And howls in the midst of the leafless wood.
Yet when the fierce swell of the tempest is raving,
And the whirlwinds howl in the caves of Inisfallen,
Still secure mid the wildest war of the sky,
The phantom courser scours the waste,
And his rider howls in the thunder's roar.
O'er him the fierce bolts of avenging Heaven
Pause, as in fear, to strike his head.
The meteors of midnight recoil from his figure,
Yet the 'wildered peasant, that oft passes by,
With wonder beholds the blue flash through his form:
And his voice, though faint as the sighs of the dead,
The startled passenger shudders to hear,
More distinct than the thunder's wildest roar.
Then does the dragon, who, chained in the caverns
To eternity, curses the champion of Erin,
Moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight,
And twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons;
Then in agony roll his death-swimming eyeballs,
Though 'wildered by death, yet never to die!
Then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares,
Who, shrieking in agony, seek the couch
Of some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain;
Then the tombless ghosts of the guilty dead
In horror pause on the fitful gale.
They float on the swell of the eddying tempest,
And scared seek the caves of gigantic [....]
Where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds
On the blast that sweeps the breast of the lake,
And mingles its swell with the moonlight air.



And the cloven waters like a chasm of mountains
Stood, and received him in its mighty portal
And led him through the deep's untrampled fountains
He went in wonder through the path immortal
Of his great Mother and her humid reign
And groves profaned not by the step of mortal
Which sounded as he passed, and lakes which rain
Replenished not girt round by marble caves
'Wildered by the watery motion of the main
Half 'wildered he beheld the bursting waves
Of every stream beneath the mighty earth
Phasis and Lycus which the [....] sand paves,
[And] The chasm where old Enipeus has its birth
And father Tyber and Anienas[?] glow
And whence Caicus, Mysian stream, comes forth
And rock-resounding Hypanis, and thou
Eridanus who bearest like empire's sign
Two golden horns upon thy taurine brow
Thou than whom none of the streams divine
Through garden-fields and meads with fiercer power,
Burst in their tumult on the purple brine



I dream'd that as I wander'd by the way
    Bare Winter suddenly was changed to Spring,
And gentle odours led my steps astray,
    Mix'd with a sound of waters murmuring
Along a shelving bank of turf, which lay
    Under a copse, and hardly dared to fling
Its green arms round the bosom of the stream,
But kiss'd it and then fled, as Thou mightest in dream.
There grew pied wind-flowers and violets,
    Daisies, those pearl'd Arcturi of the earth,
The constellated flower that never sets;
    Faint oxlips; tender blue-bells, at whose birth
The sod scarce heaved; and that tall flower that wets
Its mother's face with heaven-collected tears,
When the low wind, its playmate's voice, it hears.
And in the warm hedge grew lush eglantine,
    Green cow-bind and the moonlight-colour'd May,
And cherry-blossoms, and white cups, whose wine
    Was the bright dew yet drain'd not by the day;
And wild roses, and ivy serpentine
    With its dark buds and leaves, wandering astray;
And flowers azure, black, and streak'd with gold,
Fairer than any waken'd eyes behold.
And nearer to the river's trembling edge
    There grew broad flag-flowers, purple prank'd with white,
And starry river-buds among the sedge,
    And floating water-lilies, broad and bright,
Which lit the oak that overhung the hedge
    With moonlight beams of their own watery light;
And bulrushes, and reeds of such deep green
As soothed the dazzled eye with sober sheen.
Methought that of these visionary flowers
    I made a nosegay, bound in such a way
That the same hues, which in their natural bowers
    Were mingled or opposed, the like array
Kept these imprison'd children of the Hours
    Within my hand,—and then, elate and gay,
I hasten'd to the spot whence I had come
That I might there present it—O! to Whom?



Guido, I would that Lapo, thou, and I,
Led by some strong enchantment, might ascend
A magic ship, whose charmèd sails should fly
With winds at will where'er our thoughts might wend,
So that no change, nor any evil chance
Should mar our joyous voyage; but it might be,
That even satiety should still enhance
Between our hearts their strict community:
And that the bounteous wizard then would place
Vanna and Bice and my gentle love,
Companions of our wandering, and would grace
With passionate talk, wherever we might rove,
Our time, and each were as content and free
As I believe that thou and I should be.



Rome has fallen, ye see it lying
    Heaped in undistinguished ruin:
Nature is alone undying.



I stood within the City disinterred ;
    And heard the autumnal leaves like light footfalls
Of spirits passing through the streets; and heard
    The Mountain's slumberous voice at intervals
        Thrill through those roofless halls;
The oracular thunder penetrating shook
    The listening soul in my suspended blood;
I felt that Earth out of her deep heart spoke—
    I felt, but heard not:—through white columns glowed
        The isle-sustaining ocean-flood,
A plane of light between two heavens of azure!
    Around me gleamed many a bright sepulchre
Of whose pure beauty, Time, as if his pleasure
Were to spare Death, had never made erasure;
    But every living lineament was clear
    As in the sculptor's thought; and there
The wreaths of stony myrtle, ivy, and pine,
    Like winter leaves o'ergrown by moulded snow,
    Seemed only not to move and grow
Because the crystal silence of the air
    Weighed on their life; even as the Power divine
    Which then lulled all things, brooded upon mine.
            Then gentle winds arose
            With many a mingled close
Of wild Aeolian sound, and mountain-odours keen;
            And where the Baian ocean
            Welters with airlike motion,
Within, above, around its bowers of starry green,
    Moving the sea-flowers in those purple caves,
        Even as the ever stormless atmosphere
            Floats o'er the Elysian realm,
    It bore me, like an Angel, o'er the waves
        Of sunlight, whose swift pinnace of dewy air
            No storm can overwhelm.
            I sailed, where ever flows
            Under the calm Serene
            A spirit of deep emotion
            From the unknown graves
            Of the dead Kings of Melody 
.
Shadowy Aornos darkened o'er the helm
The horizontal aether; Heaven stripped bare
Its depth over Elysium, where the prow
Made the invisible water white as snow;
From that Typhaean mount, Inarime,
    There streamed a sunbright vapour, like the standard
            Of some aethereal host;
            Whilst from all the coast,
    Louder and louder, gathering round, there wandered
Over the oracular woods and divine sea
Prophesyings which grew articulate—
They seize me—I must speak them!—be they fate!
Naples! thou Heart of men which ever pantest
    Naked, beneath the lidless eye of Heaven!
Elysian City, which to calm enchantest
    The mutinous air and sea! they round thee, even
    As sleep round Love, are driven!
Metropolis of a ruined Paradise
    Long lost, late won, and yet but half regained!
Bright Altar of the bloodless sacrifice,
    Which armèd Victory offers up unstained
    To Love, the flower-enchained!
Thou which wert once, and then didst cease to be,
Now art, and henceforth ever shalt be, free,
    If Hope, and Truth, and Justice can avail,—
        Hail, hail, all hail!
        Thou youngest giant birth
        Which from the groaning earth
Leap'st, clothed in armour of impenetrable scale!
        Last of the Intercessors!
        Who 'gainst the Crowned Transgressors
Pleadest before God's love! Arrayed in Wisdom's mail,
        Wave thy lightning lance in mirth
        Nor let thy high heart fail,
Though from their hundred gates the leagued Oppressors
        With hurried legions move!
        Hail, hail, all hail!
What though Cimmerian Anarchs dare blaspheme
    Freedom and thee? thy shield is as a mirror
To make their blind slaves see, and with fierce gleam
    To turn his hungry sword upon the wearer;
        A new Actaeon's error
Shall theirs have been—devoured by their own hounds!
    Be thou like the imperial Basilisk
Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!
    Gaze on Oppression, till at that dread risk
    Aghast she pass from the Earth's disk:
Fear not, but gaze—for freemen mightier grow,
And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe:—
    If Hope, and Truth, and Justice may avail,
        Thou shalt be great—All hail!
        From Freedom's form divine,
        From Nature's inmost shrine,
Strip every impious gawd, rend Error veil by veil;
        O'er Ruin desolate,
        O'er Falsehood's fallen state,
Sit thou sublime, unawed; be the Destroyer pale!
        And equal laws be thine,
        And wingèd words let sail,
Freighted with truth even from the throne of God:
        That wealth, surviving fate,
        Be thine.—All hail!
Didst thou not start to hear Spain's thrilling paean
    From land to land re-echoed solemnly,
Till silence became music? From the Aeaean 


        To the cold Alps, eternal Italy
    Starts to hear thine! The Sea
Which paves the desert streets of Venice laughs
    In light and music; widowed Genoa wan
By moonlight spells ancestral epitaphs,
    Murmuring, ‘Where is Doria?’ fair Milan,
        Within whose veins long ran
The viper's  palsying venom, lifts her heel
To bruise his head. The signal and the seal
    (If Hope and Truth and Justice can avail)
    Art thou of all these hopes.—O hail!
        Florence! beneath the sun,
        Of cities fairest one,
Blushes within her bower for Freedom's expectation:
        From eyes of quenchless hope
        Rome tears the priestly cope,
As ruling once by power, so now by admiration,—
        An athlete stripped to run
        From a remoter station
For the high prize lost on Philippi's shore:—
    As then Hope, Truth, and Justice did avail,
    So now may Fraud and Wrong! O hail!
Hear ye the march as of the Earth-born Forms
    Arrayed against the ever-living Gods?
The crash and darkness of a thousand storms
    Bursting their inaccessible abodes
            Of crags and thunder-clouds?
See ye the banners blazoned to the day,
    Inwrought with emblems of barbaric pride?
Dissonant threats kill Silence far away,
    The serene Heaven which wraps our Eden wide
            With iron light is dyed;
The Anarchs of the North lead forth their legions
        Like Chaos o'er creation, uncreating;
An hundred tribes nourished on strange religions
And lawless slaveries,—down the aëreal regions
        Of the white Alps, desolating,
        Famished wolves that bide no waiting,
Blotting the glowing footsteps of old glory,
Trampling our columned cities into dust,
            Their dull and savage lust
        On Beauty's corse to sickness satiating—
They come! The field they tread look black and hoary
With fire—from their red feet the streams run gory!
            Great Spirit, deepest Love!
            Which rulest and dost move
All things which live and are, within the Italian shore;
            Who spreadest Heaven around it,
            Whose woods, rocks, waves, surround it;
Who sittest in thy star, o'er Ocean's western floor;
Spirit of beauty! at whose soft command
    The sunbeams and the showers distil its foison
            From the Earth's bosom chill;
Oh, bid those beams be each a blinding brand
            Of lightning! bid those showers be dews of poison!
            Bid the Earth's plenty kill!
            Bid thy bright Heaven above,
            Whilst light and darkness bound it,
            Be their tomb who planned
            To make it ours and thine!
    Or, with thine harmonizing ardours fill
And raise thy sons, as o'er the prone horizon
Thy lamb feeds every twilight wave with fire—
Be man's high hope and unextinct desire
The instrument to work thy will divine!
    Then clouds from sunbeams, antelopes from leopards,
            And frowns and fears from thee,
            Would not more swiftly flee
    Than Celtic wolves from the Ausonian shepherds.—
Whatever, Spirit, from thy starry shrine
    Thou yieldest or withholdest, oh, let be
    This city of thy worship ever free!
